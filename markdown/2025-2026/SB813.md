title': "SB-813: An act to add Chapter 14 (commencing with Section 8898) to Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to artificial intelligence."
summary: "Senate Bill 813, introduced by Senator McNerney in the 2025-2026 California legislative session, proposes the establishment of Multistakeholder Regulatory Organizations (MROs) to oversee the safety and risk mitigation of artificial intelligence (AI) models and applications. Under the bill, the Attorney General would designate private entities as MROs for three-year terms based on their plans to address high-impact risks such as cybersecurity and AI autonomy. MROs would certify AI developers' compliance with best practices, decertify non-compliant models, and submit annual reports on AI risks and mitigation measures. The bill also provides an affirmative legal defense for AI models certified by an MRO in civil suits for injury or property damage, except in cases of intentional misconduct. The approach aims to combine public and private expertise for agile AI governance, promote innovation, and reduce regulatory uncertainty."
