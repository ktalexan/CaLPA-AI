title': "AB-2885: An act to amend Section 22675 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 75002 of the Education Code, and to amend Sections 11546.45.5, 11547.5, and 53083.1 of the Government Code, relating to artificial intelligence."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 2885 (Chapter 843), approved in September 2024, amends several sections of California law to standardize the definition of 'artificial intelligence' (AI) as an engineered or machine-based system capable of generating outputs that influence physical or virtual environments. The bill updates requirements for state agencies to inventory and report on high-risk automated decision systems, mandates transparency from local agencies regarding economic development subsidies and the impact of AI and automation on jobs, and directs the evaluation and mitigation of risks posed by deepfakes and digital content forgery. It also ensures that the use and reporting of AI in education, technology, and social media are clearly defined and regulated, with new provisions for public reporting, risk assessment, and privacy considerations."
