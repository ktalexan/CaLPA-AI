title': "AB-222: An act to amend Section 25402 of, and to add Chapter 4.4 (commencing with Section 25345) to Division 15 of, the Public Resources Code, and to add Section 451.4 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."
summary: "California Assembly Bill 222, introduced by Assembly Member Bauer-Kahan, aims to increase transparency and efficiency in the energy use of artificial intelligence (AI) model development and data centers. The bill requires developers of large AI models to calculate and publicly disclose the total energy used in model development and the percentage generated in California before commercial use or third-party access. The California Energy Commission must adopt efficiency standards for data centers by January 1, 2027, ensure data centers report key operational information, and include data center energy trends in its policy reports. The Public Utilities Commission is tasked with ensuring that costs related to new or substantially altered data centers are fairly allocated, minimizing the financial burden on electricity ratepayers who do not directly benefit from these facilities."
