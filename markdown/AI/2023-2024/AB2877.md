Except in cases of imminent threats to health or safety, developers must obtain affirmative authorization from the consumer or their parent/guardian before using such data, and must deidentify and aggregate it before use. The bill also clarifies and updates definitions related to AI, personal information, and privacy rights, and strengthens regulatory and enforcement mechanisms under the California Privacy Protection Agency, furthering the intent of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."
