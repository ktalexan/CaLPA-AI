summary: "Assembly Bill 2930, introduced by Assembly Member Bauer-Kahan during the 2023–2024 California legislative session, aims to regulate the use of automated decision systems (including AI) in consequential decisions affecting individuals, such as employment or access to services. The bill requires developers and deployers of such systems to conduct and document annual impact assessments analyzing risks of algorithmic discrimination, notify affected individuals when such systems are used, and provide opportunities for individuals to correct data or opt for alternative processes where feasible. It prohibits the use or distribution of systems that present a reasonable risk of unlawful discrimination until those risks are mitigated, and empowers the Civil Rights Department to investigate violations and seek penalties of up to $25,000 per violation involving algorithmic discrimination. The bill also mandates public transparency policies, protects trade secrets, and exempts certain cybersecurity tools, while specifying that its remedies are cumulative and do not override existing anti-discrimination laws."
