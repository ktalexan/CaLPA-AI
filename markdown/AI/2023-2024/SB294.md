topic: "SB-294: Health care coverage: independent medical review."
title': "SB-294: An act to add Sections 1368.012 and 1374.37 to the Health and Safety Code, and to add Sections 10169.4 and 10169.6 to the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage."
summary: "Senate Bill 294, introduced by Senator Wiener and coauthors, amends California’s health care laws to require that, starting January 1, 2026, health care service plans and disability insurers must automatically submit denials, modifications, or delays of mental health or substance use disorder services for individuals up to age 26 to the Independent Medical Review System, rather than requiring the enrollee to initiate the appeal. This applies to both health plans and insurers, but excludes Medi-Cal managed care plans. The bill mandates prompt notification to affected parties, allows enrollees to withdraw from the review, and aims to address barriers to mental health care access for youth, especially among low-income and minority populations. Regulatory authorities are empowered to issue guidance, and quarterly public reporting is required. The act does not require local reimbursement as it may create new crimes or infractions."
