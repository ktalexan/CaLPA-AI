summary: "California Assembly Bill 331 (2023-2024), introduced by Assembly Member Bauer-Kahan and coauthors, aims to regulate the use of artificial intelligence-driven automated decision tools in consequential areas like employment, education, housing, healthcare, and more. The bill requires both developers and deployers of such tools (including local governments) to conduct and submit annual impact assessments to the Civil Rights Department, outlining the tool's purpose, data use, potential adverse impacts, and safeguards against algorithmic discrimination. Individuals must be notified when an automated decision tool is used to make significant decisions about them, and, where feasible, can request alternative processes. The bill prohibits algorithmic discrimination and establishes enforcement mechanisms, including administrative fines and civil actions by public attorneys or affected persons, with opportunities for violators to cure issues. The bill also mandates public disclosure of AI tool use and risk management policies, and addresses state reimbursement for local agency compliance costs."
