summary: "AB 1242, introduced by Assembly Member Nguyen, amends the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act to strengthen language access in California state agencies by expanding the definition of 'substantial number of non-English-speaking people' to include those eligible for services, updating language survey requirements to use census and community data, and mandating more detailed implementation plans and reporting.
