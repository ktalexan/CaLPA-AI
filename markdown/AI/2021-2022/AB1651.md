topic: "AB-1651: Worker rights: Workplace Technology Accountability Act."
title': "AB-1651: An act to amend Sections 12930 and 14203 of the Government Code, and to amend Section 90.5 of, and to add Part 5.6 (commencing with Section 1520) to Division 2 of, the Labor Code, relating to employment."
summary: "California Assembly Bill 1651, the Workplace Technology Accountability Act, seeks to strengthen worker rights and protections in response to increasing employer use of data collection, electronic monitoring, and automated decision systems (ADS) in the workplace. The bill requires employers to provide transparency about what data is collected, how it is used, and to limit data collection to specific, necessary purposes. Workers are granted rights to access, review, and correct their data, and employers are restricted from using monitoring or ADS outputs as the sole basis for employment decisions. The act mandates independent impact assessments for workplace technologies, prohibits certain invasive practices (like facial recognition or monitoring private areas), and establishes strong enforcement mechanisms, including civil penalties and regulatory oversight by the Labor Commissioner and Department of Fair Employment and Housing. It also requires ongoing updates to telecommuting plans and coordination among state agencies to ensure worker data protections keep pace with technological changes."
