summary: "Senate Bill 354, the Insurance Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2025, introduced by Senator Limón, updates California's insurance privacy laws to align with modern data practices and enhance consumer protections.

It grants consumers rights to access, correct, or delete their data, prohibits retaliation for exercising privacy rights, and mandates secure data handling and breach notification. The Insurance Commissioner is empowered to investigate violations and impose penalties, including fines and license suspension. The act also restricts public disclosure of sensitive compliance documents and preempts conflicting state laws, while ensuring compliance with federal privacy laws. Violations, including obtaining information under false pretenses, are subject to criminal penalties."
