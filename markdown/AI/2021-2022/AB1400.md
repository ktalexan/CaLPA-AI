summary: "California Assembly Bill 1400, known as the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (CalCare), proposes a comprehensive single-payer health care system for all California residents, regardless of immigration status. CalCare would replace most existing federal and state health programs (such as Medi-Cal, Medicare, and CHIP) by pooling their funds, providing universal coverage with no premiums, copays, or deductibles, and covering a wide range of medical, mental health, reproductive, dental, vision, and long-term care services. The program would be governed by an independent board, with oversight from advisory committees, and would require providers to participate under strict nondiscrimination and transparency rules. CalCare would negotiate prices for pharmaceuticals and medical technology (including artificial intelligence systems), control costs through global budgets, and prohibit most private billing for covered services. Implementation depends on fiscal analysis, legislative and voter approval of necessary revenue mechanisms, and federal waivers to redirect federal health funds into the CalCare Trust Fund."

## AB-1400: Guaranteed Health Care for All.

>[!tldr] **AB1400 TL;DR Summary**
> California Assembly Bill 1400, known as the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (CalCare), proposes a comprehensive single-payer health care system for all California residents, regardless of immigration status. CalCare would replace most existing federal and state health programs (such as Medi-Cal, Medicare, and CHIP) by pooling their funds, providing universal coverage with no premiums, copays, or deductibles, and covering a wide range of medical, mental health, reproductive, dental, vision, and long-term care services. The program would be governed by an independent board, with oversight from advisory committees, and would require providers to participate under strict nondiscrimination and transparency rules. CalCare would negotiate prices for pharmaceuticals and medical technology (including artificial intelligence systems), control costs through global budgets, and prohibit most private billing for covered services. Implementation depends on fiscal analysis, legislative and voter approval of necessary revenue mechanisms, and federal waivers to redirect federal health funds into the CalCare Trust Fund.
