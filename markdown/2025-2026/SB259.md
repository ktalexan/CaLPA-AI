summary: "Senate Bill 259, the Fair Online Pricing Act introduced by Senator Wahab in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, seeks to enhance consumer protection by prohibiting businesses from generating online prices based on certain device-specific data, such as hardware state, installed software, or most geolocation data, except in specific circumstances related to service delivery and demand. The bill requires clear disclosure to consumers when algorithmic pricing systems, including those powered by artificial intelligence, are used to determine prices. The act complements existing consumer privacy laws, ensuring cumulative duties and remedies, and applies only to individualized pricing, not to offers made on the same terms to the general public."
