title': "ACR-125: Relative to employment."
summary: "California Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 125, introduced in 2019, highlights persistent employment discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, despite existing laws intended to prevent such bias. The resolution cites research showing ongoing disparities in hiring and college admissions, particularly affecting Black and Latino applicants, and notes that traditional hiring practices like résumé reviews are ineffective and biased. It emphasizes the potential for innovative technologies, including artificial intelligence and algorithm-based systems, to reduce bias and improve hiring outcomes if developed and used responsibly. The resolution urges policymakers to promote standards and the adoption of such technologies to ensure fair, equitable, and non-discriminatory employment opportunities for all Californians."
