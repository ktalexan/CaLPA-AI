summary: "Assembly Bill 459, introduced by Assembly Member Kalra, amends California law to require state and local law enforcement agencies to submit annual stop data reports to the Attorney General by March 1, with semiannual reporting required if issues are identified. The bill clarifies that open text or narrative fields containing potentially personally identifiable information in stop data will only be publicly available from the reporting agency, not the Attorney General, to protect privacy. However, the Attorney General must provide all stop data, including these fields, to approved public or private entities for research on racial and identity profiling, under strict confidentiality requirements. The bill includes provisions for state reimbursement of local costs and legislative findings supporting the limitation of public access to sensitive information."
