summary: "Senate Bill 52, introduced by Senator Pérez in California's 2025-2026 session, aims to address the use of algorithmic pricing software in the residential rental market. The bill makes it unlawful to sell, license, or provide rental pricing algorithms to multiple parties with the intent to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy levels, and prohibits using such algorithms if others in the same market also use them. It also bans the use of nonpublic competitor data in these algorithms. Violations are considered unlawful restraints of trade and acts of unfair competition, enforceable by the Attorney General, local officials, or harmed individuals, with civil penalties up to $1,000 per violation. The bill responds to concerns that algorithmic pricing inflates rents, increases vacancy rates, and distorts competition, particularly impacting renters in California's high-cost housing market."
