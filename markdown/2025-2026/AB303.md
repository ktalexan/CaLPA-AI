summary: "Assembly Bill No. 303, introduced in the California Legislature for the 2025–2026 session, seeks to prohibit the approval of development projects that include large battery energy storage systems (capable of storing 200 megawatt-hours or more) if they are located within 3,200 feet of sensitive receptors (such as residences, schools, and healthcare facilities) or on environmentally sensitive sites (including wetlands, prime farmland, high fire hazard zones, and protected habitats). The bill excludes battery energy storage systems from streamlined state certification processes, requires denial of certain pending applications, and applies statewide, including to charter cities. Citing fire hazards, it is declared an urgency statute to take effect immediately, and specifies that no state reimbursement to local agencies is required."
