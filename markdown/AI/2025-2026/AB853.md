summary: "Assembly Bill 853, the California AI Transparency Act, as amended in March 2025, aims to increase transparency around generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems by requiring providers of large-scale, publicly accessible generative AI (over 1 million users) to offer free AI detection tools that help users assess whether content (image, video, audio) was created or altered by AI and to provide system provenance data. The bill also mandates that large online platforms (over 2 million users) retain and make available provenance data on posted content, and requires manufacturers of devices capable of capturing photos, audio, or video (such as phones and cameras) to include features allowing users to embed provenance data in their content. Violations are subject to civil penalties, and the bill introduces new definitions and compliance requirements for AI providers, online platforms, and device manufacturers."
