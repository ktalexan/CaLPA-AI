summary: "California Assembly Bill 288, introduced by Assembly Member McKinnor, seeks to expand the jurisdiction of the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to allow California workers covered by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to petition PERB for relief if the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) fails to act within specified timeframes. The bill responds to concerns about the NLRB's inefficacy due to inadequate funding and delays, enabling workers to vindicate their rights to free association, self-organization, and collective bargaining at the state level. The bill authorizes PERB to decide unfair labor practice cases, order remedies including civil penalties, and require binding mediation for unresolved disputes. It also establishes a dedicated enforcement fund for PERB and defines specific circumstances under which workers can seek state intervention, aiming to ensure timely and effective protection of workers' fundamental rights."
