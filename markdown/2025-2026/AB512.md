title': "AB-512: An act to amend Section 1367.01 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10123.135 of the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage."
summary: "Assembly Bill 512, introduced by Assembly Member Harabedian, amends California's Health and Safety Code and Insurance Code to expedite prior or concurrent authorization requests for health care services, requiring health plans and insurers to make standard decisions within 48 hours and urgent decisions within 24 hours of receiving necessary information. The bill also establishes strict requirements for the use of artificial intelligence and algorithms in utilization review, ensuring such tools cannot independently deny, delay, or modify care, and mandates that only qualified health professionals make final medical necessity determinations. The act enhances transparency, accountability, and patient protections, and clarifies that no state reimbursement to local agencies is required since the bill's only local impact relates to the creation or modification of crimes or penalties."
