title': "SB-11: An act to add Chapter 22.6 (commencing with Section 22650) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 3344 of the Civil Code, to add Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 1425) to Chapter 1 of Division 11 of the Evidence Code, and to add Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 540) to Title 13 of Part 1 of the Penal Code, relating to artificial intelligence technology."
summary: "Senate Bill 11, introduced by Senator Ashby in California's 2025-2026 legislative session, updates laws related to artificial intelligence (AI) by defining terms such as 'digital replica' and clarifying that using AI-generated digital replicas to impersonate someone constitutes false personation under criminal law. The bill amends civil law to treat unauthorized, AI-generated voices or likenesses as equivalent to real ones for liability purposes and removes certain legal presumptions protecting employers in advertising. It directs the Judicial Council to develop court rules for handling AI-generated evidence by 2027 and requires sellers of AI technology capable of creating digital replicas to provide consumer warnings about potential legal liabilities, with enforcement and penalties for noncompliance. The Department of Consumer Affairs must specify and publish the required warning by July 2026."
