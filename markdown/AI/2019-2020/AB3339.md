summary: "Assembly Bill No. 3339, known as the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act (KIDS Act), introduced by Assembly Member Wicks, aims to enhance online safety and protect the interests of children under 16 in California. The bill prohibits operators of child-directed online platforms from incorporating features like auto-play, push alerts, and engagement badges that encourage excessive use or purchases by children. It bans the promotion of sexual, violent, or exploitative content to minors, restricts manipulative advertising practices such as host-selling and native advertising, and limits the use of age verification data. The Act requires the Attorney General to establish regulations by 2026, including annual audits of major child-directed platforms, and violations are deemed unfair competition under California law."
