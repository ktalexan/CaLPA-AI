title': "AB-1526: An act to amend Sections 3114, 3206.2, 4584, 42040, 42041, 42051.1, 42053, 42061, 42064, 42064.01, 42067, 42081, 42464.3, 48701, 48703, and 48705 of, and to add Section 48707 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to public resources."
summary: "Assembly Bill 1526 (Chapter 848, approved October 13, 2023) makes various amendments to California's Public Resources Code, extending deadlines and updating requirements for environmental programs. Key changes include prolonging reporting and study requirements for underground injection control and oil well emissions, expanding the scope and deadlines for a study on fugitive emissions from idle and abandoned wells, and authorizing new regulatory waivers for certain timber conversion activities. The bill revises the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act by clarifying definitions, updating requirements for producer responsibility plans (including mechanisms for local fee transfers), and recasting the annual $500 million plastic surcharge as an 'environmental mitigation surcharge' with new payment procedures. It also brings aerosol spray paint under the architectural paint recovery program, setting new reporting and regulatory requirements. The bill makes technical and clarifying amendments, incorporates changes from related legislation if enacted, and specifies that no state reimbursement to local agencies is required because any costs arise from changes to criminal penalties."
