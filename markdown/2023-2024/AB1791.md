summary: "Assembly Bill No. 1791, introduced by Assembly Member Weber in the 2023–2024 California legislative session, requires that starting January 1, 2028, social media platforms must redact personal provenance data—information that can identify or be reasonably linked to a user—from content uploaded by users, unless the user gives express consent. The bill prohibits platforms from redacting system provenance data, which relates to device or content authenticity but is not user-specific, except in cases where redacting personal data also removes system data, in which case a label must be appended to the content. The bill also sets standards for consent, prohibits the use of dark patterns, and classifies violations as unfair business practices under California law."
