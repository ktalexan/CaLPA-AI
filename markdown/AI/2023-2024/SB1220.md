summary: "Senate Bill 1220, introduced by Senator Limón, requires that, until July 1, 2030, all state and certain local government agencies in California that provide or contract for call center services related to public benefit programs must use only workers employed in California, with contractors required to certify compliance or face penalties. The bill prohibits the use of artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision systems (ADS) to eliminate or automate core job functions of call center workers, though AI tools that support (but do not replace) workers are permitted. Agencies must notify workers and the public if AI or ADS impacting core job functions are used. The bill removes certain exceptions for health-related contracts, extends the right to terminate noncompliant contracts to local agencies, and includes various exceptions (e.g., emergencies, translation services, contracts predating 2025). It establishes these requirements as a statewide concern and provides for state reimbursement of local costs if mandated."
