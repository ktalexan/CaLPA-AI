summary: "California Senate Bill 503 (2025), introduced by Senator Weber Pierson and others, aims to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care by requiring developers and health care providers who use patient care decision support tools to identify uses involving protected characteristics, make reasonable efforts to mitigate discrimination risks, and test these tools for biased impacts at least every three years. The bill mandates transparency in AI-generated patient communications and defines key terms related to AI deployment in health settings. It replaces an earlier proposal for a statewide AI advisory board and standardized certification system with direct responsibilities for developers and deployers to ensure fairness and reduce bias in AI-driven clinical decision-making."
