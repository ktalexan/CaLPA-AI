Developers must provide mechanisms on their websites for copyright owners to request information about the use of their works, including submitting content fingerprints and registration numbers. Upon receiving such a request, developers have seven days to assess and report whether the copyrighted material is likely present in their training data. Failure to comply can lead to civil action and financial penalties. The requirements do not apply if all training data is made publicly available at no cost. The bill defines key terms and establishes procedures to increase transparency and accountability in AI training using copyrighted content."
