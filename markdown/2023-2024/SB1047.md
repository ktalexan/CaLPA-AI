summary: "Senate Bill 1047, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, establishes comprehensive regulations for the development and deployment of advanced AI models in California.

The bill prohibits the use or release of AI models if they pose unreasonable risks of causing critical harms, such as mass casualties or large-scale cyberattacks. It also sets requirements for operators of large computing clusters, enforces whistleblower protections, and creates the Board of Frontier Models to oversee ongoing regulation. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of 'CalCompute,' a public cloud computing resource to support safe and equitable AI innovation. These provisions aim to balance technological advancement with public safety, transparency, and accountability."
