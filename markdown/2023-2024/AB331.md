summary: "California Assembly Bill 331 aims to regulate the use of automated decision tools powered by artificial intelligence, particularly those making significant decisions impacting individuals’ lives in areas like employment, education, housing, health care, and more. The bill requires both developers and deployers of such tools to conduct annual impact assessments, document and mitigate risks of algorithmic discrimination, and provide transparency and notification to affected individuals. It prohibits the use of these tools in ways that result in unjustified discriminatory outcomes based on protected characteristics. Enforcement includes administrative fines, civil actions by public attorneys, and requirements for corrective action, with specific compliance obligations for organizations above a certain size or impact threshold. Local governments are included under these requirements, and the bill outlines procedures for state reimbursement of certain mandated costs."
