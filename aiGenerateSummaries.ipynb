      "Assembly Bill 1651 (Kalra), known as the Workplace Technology Accountability Act, proposes comprehensive new rules for California employers regarding the collection, use, and protection of worker data, especially in relation to electronic monitoring and automated decision systems (ADS). The bill grants workers rights to know, review, and correct data collected about them, restricts employers from using such data or electronic monitoring beyond specific purposes related to essential job functions or legal compliance, and bans certain invasive practices (e.g., monitoring private spaces, using facial/emotion recognition). Employers must conduct and publish impact assessments for new technologies, ensure meaningful human oversight of algorithmic decisions, and are subject to significant penalties for violations. Enforcement is led by the Labor Commissioner and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, with coordination across relevant state agencies and opportunities for workers to bring civil actions. The bill aims to increase transparency, protect worker privacy and well-being, and ensure accountability as workplace technologies evolve.\n",

The bill clarifies that using AI-generated or manipulated content to impersonate someone constitutes false personation under criminal law, and that a synthetic likeness or voice reasonably believed to be genuine is treated as the real person's likeness for civil liability. It requires AI technology providers to display consumer warnings about potential legal consequences of misuse by July 1, 2026, with penalties for noncompliance. The Judicial Council must review the impact of AI on court evidence and develop relevant rules by 2026. The bill also defines key AI and synthetic content terms and updates related sections of the Business and Professions, Civil, Evidence, and Penal Codes.\n",
