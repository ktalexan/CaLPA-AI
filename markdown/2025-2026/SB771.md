summary: "Senate Bill 771, introduced by Senator Stern in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, would hold large social media platforms (those making over $100 million annually) civilly liable if they violate state laws protecting personal rights, including through their algorithms, by aiding, abetting, or conspiring in hate crimes, intimidation, or discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected attributes. The bill cites a rise in hate crimes and online harassment, especially against vulnerable groups, and asserts that platforms can be penalized up to three months of their gross revenue per violation, with higher penalties if minors are involved. It also clarifies that deploying algorithms or artificial intelligence to relay harmful content constitutes a platform's independent action, and platforms are presumed to know how their algorithms operate. The bill replaces previous provisions about student use of social media with this new civil liability framework."
