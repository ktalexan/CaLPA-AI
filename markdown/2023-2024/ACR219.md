summary: "The California Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 219, introduced by Assembly Member Lowenthal in June 2024, urges social media platforms to adopt and protect a set of user rights known as the California Social Media Users’ Bill of Rights.

It outlines ten user rights, including protection from harmful content, prioritization of accurate election information, robust support for user reports, privacy by default, special protections for children’s data, data portability, clear policies, restrictions on AI training with user content without consent, efforts to reduce algorithmic harms, and transparency and control over algorithms, AI, and targeted ads. The resolution reflects California's push for stronger user protections in the digital age."
