title': "AB-2200: An act to add Title 23 (commencing with Section 100600) to the Government Code, relating to health care coverage, and making an appropriation therefor."
summary: "Assembly Bill 2200, the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (CalCare), proposes to establish a comprehensive, universal, single-payer health care system for all California residents, replacing most existing public and private health insurance with a state-run program. CalCare would cover a wide range of medical, dental, mental health, and long-term care services without premiums, copays, or deductibles, and would incorporate benefits from Medi-Cal, Medicare, CHIP, and Covered California. The program would be governed by an independent board, advised by several stakeholder committees, and include strong health equity provisions, protections against discrimination, and workforce transition support. Funding would come from pooled federal and state sources, with the Legislature to develop a revenue plan. Providers would be paid through negotiated rates, global budgets, or salaries, and collective negotiation for fee-for-service rates would be permitted. CalCare's implementation is contingent on securing sufficient revenue and necessary federal waivers, with strong privacy, consumer protection, and transparency requirements throughout."
