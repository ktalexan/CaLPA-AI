summary: "Assembly Bill 1545 (Kids Internet Design and Safety Act), introduced by Assembly Member Wicks in California's 2021–2022 legislative session, aims to enhance online safety and privacy protections for children under 13. The bill builds on existing privacy laws by prohibiting platform operators from enabling certain features—such as auto-play of videos and in-app purchases—without parental consent, and bans advertising of alcohol, tobacco, and nicotine products to children. It also requires platforms to provide parental controls, distinguish commercial from noncommercial content, and allow parents to create accounts or profiles for their children. The Attorney General is tasked with annually auditing platforms for compliance with state and federal child privacy laws, and violations are considered unfair competition."
