summary: "Assembly Bill 325, introduced by Assembly Member Aguiar-Curry in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, amends the Cartwright Act to address the use of pricing algorithms, particularly those utilizing artificial intelligence. The bill makes it unlawful for individuals to use or distribute a 'common pricing algorithm'—defined as any process (including those using machine learning or AI) that sets or recommends prices or commercial terms for products or services—if they know or should know it is also used by others in California to set or recommend prices or terms for similar products or services. The bill also clarifies that antitrust complaints need only plausibly allege the existence of anti-competitive agreements, without excluding independent action as a possibility. Violations expand the scope of prohibited conduct under California antitrust law and are enforceable as crimes, but no state reimbursement to local agencies is required."
