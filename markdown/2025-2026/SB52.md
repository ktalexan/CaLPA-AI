summary: "Senate Bill 52, introduced by Senator Pérez in California's 2025–2026 legislative session, seeks to address concerns over the use of algorithmic pricing software in the residential rental market. The bill makes it unlawful to sell, license, or use rental pricing algorithms to set rents, lease terms, or occupancy rates when used by two or more parties in the same or related market, especially if nonpublic competitor data is involved. It aims to prevent market manipulation, inflated rents, and reduced competition caused by such algorithms, particularly by large corporate landlords. The bill authorizes the Attorney General, local officials, and harmed individuals to file civil actions for violations, treats violations as unlawful restraints on competition under antitrust law, and specifies penalties up to $1,000 per violation. No state reimbursement to local agencies is required under this act."
