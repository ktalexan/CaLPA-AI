summary: "Assembly Bill 3211, introduced by Assembly Member Wicks in the 2023–2024 California Legislature, establishes the California Digital Content Provenance Standards to address the risks posed by generative AI technologies. The bill requires generative AI providers to embed difficult-to-remove provenance data in synthetic content, conduct adversarial testing, and provide public tools for provenance detection. It prohibits software designed to remove provenance data and mandates that new recording devices sold in California offer users the option to apply provenance data to authentic content. Large online platforms must label synthetic content and disclose provenance information, and publish annual transparency reports on deceptive synthetic content moderation. The Department of Technology is authorized to enforce the law with administrative penalties up to $100,000 per violation, with funds used to administer these provisions. The law becomes operative on July 1, 2026."
