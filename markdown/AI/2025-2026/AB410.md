summary: "Assembly Bill No. 410, introduced in the California Legislature for the 2025–2026 session, amends existing law regarding the use of bots online. The bill requires anyone using a bot that autonomously communicates with people in California to ensure the bot discloses its artificial nature at the start of communication, truthfully answers questions about its identity, and refrains from misleading users about being human. The definition of 'bot' is updated to include generative artificial intelligence outputs that could be mistaken for human interaction. Exemptions are provided for bots subject to stricter disclosure laws, and violations can result in civil penalties of $1,000 per violation, enforceable by the Attorney General or local prosecutors."
