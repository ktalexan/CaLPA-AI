summary: "Assembly Bill 3204, introduced by Assembly Member Bauer-Kahan and known as the Digesters Registration Act, would require 'data digesters'—entities that design, code, produce, or substantially modify artificial intelligence systems or services using the personal data of 1,000 or more individuals—to register annually with the California Privacy Protection Agency, pay a fee, and disclose detailed information about their AI training data and practices. The bill establishes the Data Digester Registry Fund to cover administrative and enforcement costs, prescribes penalties for non-compliance, and mandates public disclosure of registration information. It defines key terms related to AI and personal data, requires notification when AI systems are sold or transferred, and clarifies that its provisions do not supersede the California Consumer Privacy Act. The Act would become operative on February 1, 2025."
