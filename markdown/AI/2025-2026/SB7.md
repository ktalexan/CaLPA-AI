Employers are prohibited from retaliating against workers who assert these rights, and violations are enforceable by the Labor Commissioner, public prosecutors, or through civil action, with penalties of $500 per violation. The bill seeks to enhance transparency, accountability, and worker protections in the use of AI and automated systems in the workplace."
