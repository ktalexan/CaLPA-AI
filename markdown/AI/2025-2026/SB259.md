summary: "Senate Bill 259, the Fair Online Pricing Act, introduced by Senator Wahab in the 2025-2026 California legislative session, seeks to enhance consumer protection by prohibiting businesses from generating online prices for consumers based on certain device-specific input data, such as hardware state, installed software, or geolocation (with limited exceptions). The bill requires clear and conspicuous disclosure to consumers when algorithmic pricing systems, including those using artificial intelligence, are used to determine prices. The act's requirements are cumulative with existing laws, and its remedies are in addition to those already available under California law."
