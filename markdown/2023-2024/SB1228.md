title': "SB-1228: An act to add Chapter 22.9 (commencing with Section 22684) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, relating to social media platforms."
summary: "Senate Bill 1228, introduced by Senator Padilla in the 2023–2024 California legislative session, would require social media platforms with over 1,000,000 California users to verify the identities of influential and highly influential users—those whose content reaches large audiences—by confirming their name, phone, and email, and, for highly influential users, reviewing government-issued ID. Platforms must clearly display whether such users are authenticated or not on their profiles and posts, allow users to opt out of seeing unauthenticated users' content, and protect sensitive information. The bill authorizes legal action to enforce compliance and exempts smaller platforms. It does not mandate reduced visibility for unauthenticated users and allows platforms to set stricter policies if desired."
