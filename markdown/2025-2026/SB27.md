summary: "Senate Bill 27, introduced by Senator Umberg in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes amendments to Section 5977 of the Welfare and Institutions Code as part of the Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment (CARE) Court Program. The CARE Act allows certain adults with severe mental illness, particularly those diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, to receive behavioral health services through voluntary agreements or court-ordered CARE plans. SB 27 would enable courts to conduct the initial appearance on a CARE petition at the same time as the prima facie determination if certain requirements are met, streamlining the process for timely assistance. The bill is declared an urgency statute to take immediate effect to enhance the effectiveness of the CARE Act, which began in October 2023."
