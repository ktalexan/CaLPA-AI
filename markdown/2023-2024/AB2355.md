title': "AB-2355: An act to amend Sections 84504, 84504.1, 84504.2, 84504.3, 84054.4, and 84504.5 of, and to add Section 84514 to, the Government Code, relating to the Political Reform Act of 1974."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 2355, approved in September 2024, amends the Political Reform Act of 1974 to require political committees that create, publish, or distribute political advertisements generated or substantially altered using artificial intelligence (AI) to include a clear disclosure stating, "Ad generated or substantially altered using artificial intelligence." The bill defines what constitutes AI-generated or altered media and prescribes specific disclosure formatting requirements depending on the advertisement medium (radio, TV, print, electronic media, etc.). Enforcement is handled by the Fair Political Practices Commission, which may seek injunctive relief or civil penalties for noncompliance, but violations are not classified as misdemeanors. The bill aims to enhance transparency in political advertising as AI technology becomes more prevalent."
