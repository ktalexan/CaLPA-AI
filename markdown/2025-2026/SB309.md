summary: "Senate Bill 309, introduced by Senator Jones in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes a technical, nonsubstantive amendment to Section 12306.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, which governs the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program that helps aged, blind, and disabled individuals remain in their homes. The bill maintains that when counties negotiate or impose increases in provider wages or benefits, the county must use its own funds for both the county and state shares of the cost, unless otherwise specified by the state budget or statute. It also reaffirms the conditions and cost-sharing arrangements between the state and counties for wage and benefit increases, including limits and procedures for state participation and county responsibilities."
