title': "SB-970: An act to add Chapter 22.7 (commencing with Section 22650) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 3344 of the Civil Code, to add Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 1425) to Chapter 1 of Division 11 of the Evidence Code, and to add Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 540) to Title 13 of Part 1 of the Penal Code, relating to artificial intelligence technology."
summary: "Senate Bill 970, introduced by Senator Ashby in California's 2023–2024 legislative session, aims to address the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic content such as deepfakes. The bill clarifies that using AI-generated synthetic content to impersonate someone is considered false personation under criminal law, and establishes that AI-generated voices or likenesses that could reasonably be mistaken for real are treated as genuine for civil liability. It requires providers of AI technology capable of creating synthetic content to warn consumers about potential legal consequences of misuse, with penalties for noncompliance. The Judicial Council must review the impact of AI on court evidence and develop rules to help courts assess claims of AI-generated or manipulated evidence. The Department of Consumer Affairs will determine and post the required consumer warning. The bill updates definitions and enforcement mechanisms across business, civil, evidence, and penal codes to address risks related to AI-generated synthetic content."
