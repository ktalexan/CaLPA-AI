summary: "Senate Bill 1282, introduced by Senator Smallwood-Cuevas in the 2023–2024 California legislative session, seeks to expand and clarify diversion programs for individuals charged with theft and other eligible offenses. The bill allows county pretrial or health departments and nonprofit agencies to run diversion programs, defines theft offenses, and sets out criteria for program referral, including assessments of risk, needs, and willingness to make restitution. It also broadens judicial discretion to offer diversion in more cases, requires courts to consider ordering participation in treatment or support programs, and lists offenses that are ineligible for diversion, such as violent felonies, sex crimes, and domestic violence. The goal is to address underlying causes of criminal behavior and reduce recidivism through alternatives to prosecution where appropriate."
