            "summary": "Assembly Bill 21 (2025), known as the Homeowner Association Accountability and Transparency Act, proposes significant amendments to California's Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act to enhance transparency, accountability, and member rights in homeowners association (HOA) governance. Key changes include requiring individual notice for rule changes, prohibiting board members from discussing association business outside authorized meetings, mandating agenda packet access and detailed meeting minutes, and requiring electronic recording of open board meetings. The bill also strengthens litigation and insurance disclosure requirements, expands members' rights to inspect records (with free electronic access), and facilitates legal recourse in both superior and small claims courts for violations. Election procedures are clarified, removing secret ballot requirements for operating rule amendments and ensuring no member is denied a ballot except for non-membership. The bill further updates definitions, record-keeping, and privacy protections, aiming to make HOA operations more open and fair for all members.",

            "summary": "Assembly Bill 23, the Cost of Living Reduction Act of 2025, aims to lower energy costs in California by requiring the Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission to publicly track and report the state's gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices compared to national averages, and to identify California-specific factors contributing to higher costs. If state prices for these energy sources exceed the national average by more than 10%, the bill mandates a temporary six-month suspension of related state taxes, fees, and cap-and-trade requirements for affected entities. It also establishes a rebate program for qualifying households, funded by transfers from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, to offset higher energy costs, with rebates capped at $2,500 per household and income eligibility limits. The bill further prohibits the adoption or expansion of fixed utility charges after January 1, 2026, and requires a study on the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the cost of living, with recommendations for broader application.",

The bill centralizes collective bargaining for IHSS workers at the state level, allowing providers to form or join employee organizations, and sets procedures for dispute resolution, bargaining unit mergers, payroll deductions, and the protection of workers’ rights. It also mandates the state to honor existing agreements, prescribes new rules for sharing personal information with unions, revises provider orientation requirements, and creates an advisory committee. The legislation addresses matters of statewide concern, modifies public records access provisions, and outlines fiscal and local government responsibilities, including potential state reimbursement for mandated costs.",

Existing law deems a public authority created under these provisions to be the employer of in-home supportive services personnel under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act,\n\t\twhich governs labor relations between local public employers and employees. Existing law also deems a nonprofit consortium contracting with a county to be the employer of in-home supportive services personnel for purposes of collective bargaining over wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. Existing law grants recipients of in-home supportive services the right to hire, fire, and supervise the work of any in-home supportive services personnel providing services for them.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Existing law prohibits the state and specified local public employers from deterring or discouraging public employees from becoming or remaining members of an employee organization. Existing law also requires specified public employers to provide exclusive employee representatives access to new employee orientations. Existing law generally grants the Public Employment Relations Board jurisdiction over violations of these provisions. Existing law defines âpublic employersâ who are\n\t\tsubject to these provisions as including, among others, public agencies, cities, counties, and districts.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would expand the definition of âpublic employer,â for purposes of those provisions, to include an employer who is subject to the In-Home Supportive Services Employer-Employee Relations Act, which the bill would create. The bill would establish a method for resolving disputes regarding wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment between the state and recognized employee organizations representing individual providers. The bill would provide for the right of employees, also known as individual providers under the act, to form, join, and participate in activities of employee organizations for the purposes of representation on all matters within the scope of employee organizations. The bill would define âemployeeâ or âindividual providerâ for these purposes to mean a person authorized to provide in-home supportive services pursuant to the\n\t\tindividual provider mode or waiver personal care services, as prescribed.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would, for purposes of collective bargaining, deem the state to be the employer of record of individual providers in each county. The bill would grant the in-home supportive services recipient with the right to hire, fire, and supervise the work of the individual providers providing services to them. Among other things, the bill would specify that individual providers employed by a predecessor agency before January 1, 2026, shall retain employee status and not be required by the state to requalify to receive payment for providing in-home supportive services.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Among other things, for purposes of collective bargaining, this bill would provide that existing bargaining units consisting of individual providers in a single county that are represented by the same recognized employee organization shall be deemed merged into the largest possible\n\t\tmulticounty bargaining units represented by that employee organization. In counties where no recognized employee organization exists as of January 1, 2026, the bill would specify that a bargaining unit consisting of all employees in that county shall be deemed an appropriate unit for collective bargaining. Under the bill, if individual providers in a county bargaining unit are represented by a recognized employee organization on January 1, 2026, the state would be deemed the successor employer of the predecessor agency for purposes of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement, subject to the obligation to meet and confer in good faith and meet other related legal requirements.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would require all recognized employee organizations, as of January 1, 2026, to negotiate jointly on behalf of all bargaining units they represent to reach a single memorandum of understanding with the employer. The bill would authorize the memorandum of understanding to contain\n\t\taddenda reflecting regional or county-level terms and conditions. The bill would establish procedures for voting and ratification of a memorandum of understanding, and for the employer to assume a predecessor agencyâs rights and obligations under a memorandum of understanding or agreement between a predecessor agency and a recognized employee organization that is in effect on January 1, 2026.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would prescribe the duties of the state under the bill, including requiring the Governor to meet and confer in good faith, and to follow specified procedures regarding collective bargaining. If an agreement is reached by a representative of the Governor and the recognized employee organizations, the bill would require those parties to jointly prepare a written memorandum of understanding and present it to the Legislature for determination by majority vote. The bill would require the Governor, for any side letter, appendix, or other addendum to a memorandum of\n\t\tunderstanding that requires the expenditure of $250,000 or more related to salary and benefits not included in the original memorandum or the Budget Act, to provide that to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, as specified. The bill would also establish mediation and arbitration procedures that would apply when the parties fail to reach an agreement.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would make certain actions by an employer and other entities involved in administering the IHSS program unlawful, including imposing or threatening to impose reprisals on employees or otherwise interfering with the exercise of their rights. The bill would authorize the Public Employment Relations Board to adopt reasonable rules and regulations pursuant to the bill, including the adoption of emergency regulations, as prescribed.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(2)Â Existing law requires the Controller to provide for the administration of payroll deductions and salary\n\t\treductions, and authorizes the Controller to establish procedures for that purpose.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would require the Controller to honor a written authorization for payroll deductions executed by an employee before January 1, 2026, and to make deductions for payments of dues to a recognized employee organization pursuant to the bill consistent with the above-described payroll deduction procedures.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(3)Â Existing law, the California Public Records Act, requires public records to be open to inspection at all times during the office hours of the state or local agency that retains those records, and provides that every person has a right to inspect any public record, except as provided. Existing law provides that certain information regarding persons paid by the state to provide in-home supportive services, or other related public services, are not subject to disclosure under those provisions. Existing law\n\t\tfurther provides that copies of names, addresses, home telephone numbers, and other identifying information are required to be made available, upon request, to an exclusive bargaining agent and to any employee organization seeking representation rights under specified collective bargaining provisions.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would, with respect to the above-described personal identifying information, instead require this information to be made available to the exclusive bargaining agent and any employee organization seeking representation under the bill. The bill would require the state, or a county, public authority, or nonprofit consortium organized pursuant to the IHSS program, to promptly make the information available to the requesting entity.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would revise the IHSS program provisions to require the state to assume responsibilities as set forth in the bill. The bill would also\n\t\trequire a county or city and county to continue to have certain IHSS program-related functions set forth in county ordinance or contract performed in accordance with specified provisions.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(4)Â Existing law requires prospective providers of in-home supportive services to complete an in-person provider orientation at the time of enrollment that is developed by the department, in consultation with counties, that includes requirements to be an eligible IHSS provider and other related matters.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill additionally would require that in-person provider orientation include any other information required to be communicated to prospective providers by a memorandum of understanding, appendix, or side letter between recognized employee organizations and the state.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Existing law requires a specified mediation process, including a factfinding panel recommending settlement\n\t\tterms, to be held if a public authority or nonprofit consortium and an employee organization fail to reach agreement on a bargaining contract with in-home supportive service (IHSS) workers on or after October 1, 2023.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\"> This bill would make that provision inoperative. The bill would also require the department to appoint an advisory committee to provide ongoing advice and recommendations regarding in-home supportive services, as specified. The bill would make other related changes to these provisions. By imposing new duties on local government officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(5)This bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern and, therefore, apply to all counties.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(6)The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring\n\t\tpublic access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(7)Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(8)The California Constitution requires the state\n\t\tto reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

The bill responds to concerns about the NLRB's inefficacy due to inadequate funding and delays, enabling workers to vindicate their rights to free association, self-organization, and collective bargaining at the state level. The bill authorizes PERB to decide unfair labor practice cases, order remedies including civil penalties, and require binding mediation for unresolved disputes. It also establishes a dedicated enforcement fund for PERB and defines specific circumstances under which workers can seek state intervention, aiming to ensure timely and effective protection of workers' fundamental rights.",

These employers are refusing to bargain and committing other unfair labor practices with impunity. This means that California workers who choose to unionize are often forced to wait for years to have their right to meet their employer at the bargaining table vindicated.

It also expands existing crimes related to deceptive ballot collection to include misleading envelopes, and addresses state reimbursement obligations for local mandates created by the bill.",

The bill would prohibit public employers from questioning employees or their representatives about confidential communications related to union representation, and from compelling disclosure of such communications to third parties, except in cases of criminal investigations or certain public safety officer situations. This measure aims to ensure employees can communicate freely with their union representatives without fear of reprisal or forced disclosure, thereby enhancing the integrity of employer-employee relations in the public sector.",

The bill updates the definition of 'licensed health care professional' for IHSS eligibility and paramedical service certification purposes, aligning it with the broader 'health care practitioner' definition in Section 680 of the Business and Professions Code. It clarifies that applicants or recipients must obtain certification from such professionals to receive paramedical services, specifies documentation and notification requirements, and ensures that professionals cannot charge a fee for completing the necessary certification. The bill also provides for certain exceptions and procedural details related to the certification process.",

The bill mandates that pets rescued from evacuation zones cannot be adopted out, euthanized, or transferred for at least 90 days, except in cases of irremediable suffering, and after that period, local rescue and foster partners must be given the opportunity to take custody before any other action. The bill also establishes reimbursement procedures for any state-mandated local costs and aims to improve coordination and support for pet owners during emergencies.",

The bill allows nonrelative extended family members to sign caregiver authorization affidavits, clarifies and updates the statutory affidavit form, and enables courts to appoint joint guardians for minors when custodial parents are temporarily unavailable, including for immigration-related reasons. It also mandates that schools and licensed child day care facilities not collect immigration or citizenship information except as required by law, requires these institutions to adopt and update model policies limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement, and ensures confidentiality of related records. The act imposes new duties on educational and child care agencies and includes provisions for state reimbursement of mandated costs.",

Under existing law, a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older, signs the caregiverâs authorization affidavit under penalty of perjury, and who is a certain type of relative of the minor who lives in their home, has the same rights to authorize medical care and dental care for the minor that are given to guardians, as specified. Under existing law, a person who acts in good faith reliance on a completed caregiverâs authorization affidavit to provide medical or dental care, without actual knowledge of facts contrary to those stated on the affidavit, is not subject to criminal or\n\t\t\t civil liability or professional disciplinary action for that reliance, but is not relieved from liability for violations of other provisions of law.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill, the Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025, would expand the type of person who is authorized to execute a caregiverâs authorization affidavit to include a ânonrelative extended family member,â as defined, and grant them the same rights to authorize school-related medical care, as defined, for the minor that are given to guardians, as specified. By expanding who is authorized to sign a caregiverâs authorization affidavit for these purposes under penalty of perjury, this bill would expand the crime of perjury, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would amend the statutory form for a caregiverâs authorization affidavit.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(2)Â Existing law generally provides for the establishment and\n\t\t\t administration of guardianships. Existing law authorizes a court to appoint joint guardians of a person, an estate, or a person and an estate. Existing law requires a nomination of a guardian to become effective when made, and remain effective, unless stated otherwise in writing, as specified.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would authorize a court, in its discretion, to appoint a custodial parent and a person nominated by the custodial parent as joint guardians of the person of the minor, if the custodial parent will be temporarily unavailable due to specified circumstances, including, among other things, an immigration-related administrative action, as specified. The bill would make all records, petitions, orders, and documents related to these proceedings confidential, as specified.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">The bill would provide that absence is a basis for a delayed effectiveness of a guardianship and that such circumstances would not be a basis for subsequent legal\n\t\t\t incapacity for the nomination.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(3)Â <font color=\"blue\" class=\"blue_text\"><i>Existing law prohibits, except as required by state or federal law or as required to administer a state or federally supported educational program, school officials and employees of a local educational agency, as defined, from collecting information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of pupils or their family members. </i></font>Existing law requires the governing board or body of a local educational agency to perform specified actions relating to pupils and immigration status, including, among others, providing information to parents and guardians, as appropriate, regarding their childâs right to a free public education, regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs. Existing law requires the Attorney General, by April 1, 2018, in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders, to\n\t\t\t publish model policies limiting assistance with immigration enforcement at public schools, to the fullest extent possible consistent with federal and state law, as specified. Existing law requires all local educational agencies to adopt the model policies developed by the Attorney General, or equivalent policies, by July 1, 2018.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would revise the information disclosure requirements to require the governing board or body of a local educational agency to provide information related to specified guidance on immigration enforcement issued by the Attorney General and would require that information to be revised as necessary to be consistent with any revisions or updates to the Attorney Generalâs guidance. This bill would also require local educational agencies to revise their model policies as necessary to be consistent with any revisions or updates to the model policies developed by the Attorney General, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local\n\t\t\t educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</div><font color=\"blue\" class=\"blue_text\"><i><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(4)Â Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child day care facilities, including day care centers and day care homes, by the State Department of Social Services.

The bill would require the owner, operator, or administrator of a licensed child day care facility, as applicable, to report to the department and the Attorney General any requests for information or access to the facility by an officer or employee of a law enforcement agency for the purpose of enforcing the immigration laws in a manner that ensures the confidentiality and privacy of any potentially identifying information. The bill would require a licensed child day care facility to first exhaust any parental instruction relating to the childâs care found in the childâs emergency contact information if an employee of a licensed child day care facility is aware that a childâs parent or guardian is not available to care for the child. The bill would encourage facilities to work with parents or guardians to update their emergency contact information. The bill would require the Attorney\n\t\t\t General, by April 1, 2026, in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders, to publish model policies limiting assistance with immigration enforcement at child day care facilities similar to the model policies developed for local educational agencies described above. The bill would require all licensed child day care facilities to adopt the model policies developed by the Attorney General, or equivalent policies, as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 1, 2026. The bill would require licensed day care facilities to update these policies to conform with any revisions or updates to the model policies developed by the Attorney General. Upon enrolling or reenrolling any child, the bill would require a licensed child day care facility to provide the parent or guardian with written information relating to the model policies developed by the Attorney General described above, including, but not limited to, information related to family safety plans and the importance of completing and maintaining\n\t\t\t emergency contact information. The bill would require the provided information to be updated to include any revisions or updates to the model policies issued by the Attorney General. Because a violation of these provisions by a licensed day care facility would constitute a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</div></i></font> <font color=\"#B30000\"><strike><p style=\"display:inline;\"><s>(4)</s></p><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\"></div></strike></font><font color=\"blue\" class=\"blue_text\"><i><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(5)</i></font>Â Existing constitutional provisions require a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies to be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</div><font color=\"#B30000\"><strike><p style=\"display:inline;\"><s>(5)</s></p><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\"></div></strike></font><font color=\"blue\" class=\"blue_text\"><i><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(6)</i></font>Â The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Separation of a child from their parent or primary caregiver has known developmental, psychological, and physical impacts. Younger children are especially vulnerable. During these early years, children are developing emotionally and physically, and forming attachments that help with emotional regulation, sense of identity, and psychological safety. Separating parents and caregivers who are key attachment figures during this vulnerable period can have lifelong impacts on\n\t\t\t\tchildrenâs emotional and physical wellbeing.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(b)Â Stable caregiving arrangements are essential for the health, safety, and emotional well-being of children, particularly in times of crisis. The state recognizes the unique challenges faced by immigrant families due to the federal administrationâs enhanced deportation actions, which risk widespread family separations and disrupt caregiving stability for children under 18 years of age.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(c)Â Despite existing tools, such as caregiver authorization affidavits and guardianship nominations, families and caregivers face significant uncertainty due to the lack of clarity, consistency, and enforceability of these mechanisms, resulting in schools and service providers refusing to accept them. Temporary and general guardianship options, while\n\t\t\t\tavailable, fail to adequately safeguard the rights of parentsâparticularly immigrant parentsâto remain involved in their childâs upbringing during periods of\n\t\t\t\timmigration detention or deportation. These gaps in the legal framework exacerbate the emotional trauma experienced by children, disrupt access to education and health care, and hinder the ability of families to respond effectively to crises.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(d)Â To address these challenges, the Legislature seeks to ensure that children facing the risk of family separation due to a parentâs immigration status have stable and legally recognized caregiving arrangements that protect their emotional and physical well-being. The intent of the Legislature is to provide clear and streamlined processes for short-term guardianships that address urgent needs, such as medical care and educational decisionmaking, while upholding the rights of parents. It is also the intent of the Legislature to refine the scope of guardianship nominations by delineating\n\t\t\t\tthe rights and responsibilities of nominated guardians. Finally, it is the intent of the Legislature to clarify the powers granted under caregiver authorization affidavits to ensure consistent recognition by schools, health care providers, and other agencies to demonstrate continued support for children who reside with a relative or nonrelative extended family member caregiver.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(e)Â By establishing a more coherent legal structure, it is the intent of the Legislature to reduce uncertainty and administrative barriers, enabling families to act swiftly and effectively in times of crisis. Supporting the stability of caregiving arrangements will mitigate the negative impacts on childrenâs mental health, educational outcomes, and overall well-being. These efforts reflect Californiaâs commitment to protecting vulnerable families and upholding the fundamental\n\t\t\t\trights of children and parents.</div></div></div><div id=\"s30.8607163967287854\"><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0\" class=\"ActionLine\"><h3 style=\"font-weight:bold; display:inline;\">SEC. 3.</h3>Â Section 234.7 of the Education Code is amended to read:</div><div><div id=\"id_61B910A2-AE34-464A-96CF-17E7C9BEBD7C\"><div><p><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\"><h6 style=\"display:inline;\">234.7.</h6>Â (a)Â Except as required by state or federal law or as required to administer a state or federally supported educational program, school officials and employees of a local educational agency shall not collect information or documents regarding citizenship or immigration status of pupils or their family members.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(b)Â The superintendent of a school district, the superintendent of a county office of education, and the principal of a charter school, as applicable, shall report to the respective governing board or body of the local educational agency in a timely manner any requests for information or access to a schoolsite by an officer or employee of a law enforcement agency for the purpose of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tenforcing the immigration laws in a manner that ensures the confidentiality\n\t\t\t\t\t\tand privacy of any potentially identifying information.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(c)Â If an employee of a school is aware that a pupilâs parent or guardian is not available to care for the pupil, the school shall first exhaust any parental instruction relating to the pupilâs care in the emergency contact information it has for the pupil to arrange for the pupilâs care.

The bill requires creators of publicly accessible generative AI systems with over one million users to provide free AI detection tools that allow users to determine if content was created or altered by AI and to access any system provenance data. Additionally, large online platforms must retain and make available provenance data in posted content, while manufacturers of capture devices (such as cameras and smartphones) must enable users to include provenance data in their recordings. Violations by AI providers, large platforms, or device manufacturers are subject to civil penalties.",

The bill prohibits the Judicial Council from approving new purchases or leases of electronic recording equipment solely for monitoring subordinate judicial officers, and mandates that transcripts from such recordings indicate any inaudible or unintelligible portions. Courts must make ongoing efforts to hire certified shorthand reporters, maintain transparency in hiring practices, and cannot displace current reporters without consent.

            "summary": "California Assembly Bill 1189 (2025) proposes to expand the regulation of court reporting by establishing certification for digital reporters and legal transcriptionists, alongside existing shorthand reporters. Certified digital reporters would be authorized to swear in witnesses and digitally capture legal proceedings, while legal transcriptionists would be able to transcribe and certify transcripts for legal use. The bill outlines qualifications, fees, and duties for these new roles and prohibits courts from replacing certified shorthand reporters with digital reporters or transcriptionists as an unfair labor practice. It also updates laws to allow depositions and court proceedings to be recorded and transcribed digitally under certain conditions, ensures admissibility of digital transcripts, and requires that transcripts from digital recordings be prepared by certified legal transcriptionists. The bill includes appropriations and expands the scope of existing crimes, thereby creating a state-mandated local program.",

Effective January 1, 2026, the bill aligns pensionable compensation limits with federal standards, establishes new and more generous retirement formulas for safety members (including options up to 3% at age 55), and allows employers and employees to negotiate higher or lower benefit plans through collective bargaining. The bill also permits employers to pay a portion of employee pension contributions, reversing a key restriction of the 2013 Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act (PEPRA). These reforms aim to address recruitment and retention challenges, reflect the unique risks and demands of safety professions, and maintain the sustainability of the retirement system, while ensuring that accrued benefits before the law's effective date are protected.",

The measure would change the required annual transfer from the General Fund to the Budget Stabilization Account from a fixed 1.5% to an undetermined percentage of estimated revenues, and increase the maximum allowable balance in the Account from 10% to 20% of General Fund tax proceeds. Additionally, it clarifies that transfers to the Budget Stabilization Account do not count as appropriations subject to the state's annual spending limit. The amendment aims to give the state more flexibility in managing budget reserves and fiscal planning.",

The bill also mandates the Department of Housing and Community Development to develop, in coordination with local jurisdictions, a comprehensive 10-year assessment and financing plan to address unsheltered and chronic homelessness, with a report due to the Legislature by December 31, 2027. The assessment must detail the current and projected numbers of unsheltered individuals, unmet service needs, evidence-based interventions, required funding, and recommendations for state and local action. The bill imposes state-mandated local programs and provides for reimbursement of costs if determined necessary, and explicitly applies to all California cities, including charter cities.",

The bill allows cities and counties to reduce the number of required replacement units when rehabilitating or converting SRO buildings into studio or larger units, provided certain affordability, tenant protection, and replacement conditions are met, with the net loss of SRO units capped at 25%. It also clarifies eligibility for housing assistance programs for homeless individuals and families, allowing them to bypass coordinated entry system referrals under certain circumstances. The bill includes strong tenant protections, affordability covenants, and requirements for local planning and reporting, and will only be implemented if appropriated funds are provided by the Legislature.",

The exemption applies to principal residences for property tax lien dates from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2035. To qualify, claimants must provide documentation of disability, and no other real property tax exemptions can be claimed for the same residence. The bill aims to reduce homelessness among disabled veterans, requires annual reporting on its effectiveness, and while it imposes duties on local officials, it does not provide state reimbursement for lost local tax revenue. The act takes effect immediately upon passage.",

The CARE Act allows certain adults with severe mental illness, particularly those diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, to receive behavioral health services through voluntary agreements or court-ordered CARE plans. SB 27 would enable courts to conduct the initial appearance on a CARE petition at the same time as the prima facie determination if certain requirements are met, streamlining the process for timely assistance. The bill is declared an urgency statute to take immediate effect to enhance the effectiveness of the CARE Act, which began in October 2023.",

            "summary": "Senate Bill 36, as amended in the California Legislature, strengthens protections against price gouging during states of emergency or local emergencies. The bill expands civil penalties for unfair competition and deceptive practices targeting people displaced by emergencies, including a civil penalty up to $2,500 per violation. It makes price gouging during emergencies an unlawful act under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and extends enhanced penalties to displaced persons, similar to those for seniors, disabled persons, and veterans. The bill requires housing listing platforms (like online rental sites) to monitor and report suspected price gouging, maintain related policies, and provide reporting mechanisms. It clarifies and broadens the scope of existing price gouging laws, applying them to all affected and adjacent counties, and authorizes search warrants for evidence of price gouging violations. The legislation aims to ensure that emergency-related price protections are robustly enforced, especially for vulnerable populations.",

The bill strengthens prohibitions against unlawful solicitation of legal services (including the use of 'runners' or 'cappers'), expands the definitions of 'advertise' and 'advertisement,' and imposes stricter rules on legal advertising content—such as banning misleading statements, unverified claims about skills or results, and references to awards or recognitions from non-bona fide organizations. It also allows any person (or, in the case of deceptive advertising, any misled consumer) to bring civil actions for violations, with statutory damages ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per violation, plus attorney fees and other relief, and requires courts to consider the seriousness and persistence of misconduct in awarding damages.",

It removes several procedural requirements for ordinance passage and allows local governments to use a streamlined, ministerial approval process when amending zoning ordinances to comply with updated general plans. This streamlining would expand exemptions under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for certain housing developments, making it easier for local agencies to approve projects consistent with updated general plans.",

The bill also revises procedures for recovering overpayments and imposes new reporting requirements and penalties for employers regarding retired employees. Overall, the bill aims to streamline administration, ensure compliance with PEPRA, and clarify financial and operational rules for public employee retirement systems.",

STRS is administered by the Teachersâ Retirement Board. Existing law requires employers and employees to make contributions to the system based on the memberâs creditable compensation. Existing law defines terms for the purposes of STRS. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Existing law defines âemployerâ or âemploying agencyâ to mean the state or any agency or political subdivision thereof, including a joint powers authority, as specified.

Existing law vests management and control of PERS in its board of administration. PERS provides a defined benefit to members of the program, based on final compensation, credited service, and age at retirement, subject to certain variations. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Existing law, the California Public Employeesâ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA), on and after January 1, 2013, requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with PEPRA, as specified. Among other things, PEPRA prohibits a public employer from offering a defined benefit pension plan exceeding specified\n\t\t\t retirement formulas and requires new members of public retirement systems to contribute at least a specified amount of the normal cost, as defined. PEPRA defines âpensionable compensationâ for a new member of any public retirement system to mean the normal monthly rate of pay or base pay of the member paid in cash to similarly situated members of the same group or class of employment for services rendered on a full-time basis, as specified.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Under PERL, the highest annual average compensation during any consecutive 12- or 36-month period of employment as a member of a retirement system maintained by the University of California is considered compensation earnable by a member of PERS for purposes of computing final compensation for the member providing that member retires concurrently under both systems. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would instead specify that the highest annual average compensation in the above-described\n\t\t\t circumstances shall be considered compensation earnable or pensionable compensation pursuant to PEPRA, whichever is applicable. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">PERL defines âstate serviceâ solely for purposes of qualification for benefits and retirement allowances under PERS to also include service rendered as an officer or employee of a county if the salary for the service constitutes compensation earnable by a member of PERS, as prescribed.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would instead provide that âstate serviceâ in the above-described circumstances shall be considered compensation earnable or pensionable compensation pursuant to PEPRA, whichever is applicable.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">PERL also provides that the highest annual compensation during any 12- or 36-month period of employment as a member of a county retirement system is considered compensation earnable by a member of PERS for purposes of computing final compensation, as prescribed.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would instead specify that the highest annual average compensation in the above-described circumstances shall be considered compensation earnable or pensionable compensation pursuant to PEPRA, whichever is applicable. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Under PERL, the compensation<font color=\"blue\" class=\"blue_text\"><i> earnable</i></font> during any period of service as a member of the Judgesâ Retirement System, the Judgesâ Retirement System II, the Legislatorsâ Retirement System, or the Defined Benefit Program of the State Teachersâ Retirement Plan is considered compensation earnable as a member of PERS for purposes of computing final compensation for the member, if that member retires concurrently under both systems.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would instead specify that the compensation during any period of service, as described above, is considered compensation\n\t\t\t earnable or pensionable compensation under PEPRA, whichever is applicable, for purposes of computing final compensation. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">(4)Â Existing law, the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (CERL), authorizes counties to establish retirement systems pursuant to its provisions in order to provide pension benefits to county, city, and district employees and their beneficiaries. Under existing law, CERL provides for a defined retirement benefit based upon credited service, final compensation, and age at retirement subject to specified formulas relating to membership classification.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Existing law provides that, for a member who is subject to PEPRA, a specified definition of âfinal compensationâ contained in that law applies for all or any portion of their membership in the county retirement system. Existing law provides that when determining final compensation for a member who does not have 3 consecutive years of\n\t\t\t earned pensionable compensation due to an absence, the compensation for any absence is based on the pensionable compensation of the position held by the member immediately prior to the absence.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would delete that latter provision. The bill would revise the above provision concerning PEPRA to specify that the compensation for any absence is based on the pensionable compensation of the position held by the member at the beginning of the absence.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Existing law provides that local prosecutors, local public defenders, and local public defender investigators are eligible to participate in CERL, as specified. Under existing law, past service as a general member is required to be converted to safety service if the past service was rendered in a position that has subsequently been reclassified as a safety position pursuant to that provision.</div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This bill would revise that provision to\n\t\t\t specify that it applies to service before January 1, 2013.

Trump and Congress to pass federal legislation guaranteeing comprehensive rights and protections for classified school workers (such as paraeducators, clerical staff, bus drivers, and custodians). The resolution highlights issues such as undercompensation, lack of benefits, inadequate staffing, and exclusion from policy decisions, and calls for livable wages, affordable healthcare, paid leave (including for school closures and family needs), professional development, workplace safety, job security, inclusion in policy-making, protections regarding the use of artificial intelligence and monitoring technologies, and the right to collective bargaining. The measure emphasizes the essential role of classified workers in supporting students and maintaining effective, safe school environments.",
