title': "AB-23: An act to add Chapter 6.6 (commencing with Section 25560) to Division 15 of the Public Resources Code, and to amend Section 739.9 of, and to add Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 8410) to Division 4.1 of, the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy, and making an appropriation therefor."
summary: "Assembly Bill 23, the Cost of Living Reduction Act of 2025, aims to lower energy costs in California by requiring the Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission to publicly track and report the state's gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices compared to national averages, and to identify California-specific factors contributing to higher costs. If state prices for these energy sources exceed the national average by more than 10%, the bill mandates a temporary six-month suspension of related state taxes, fees, and cap-and-trade requirements for affected entities. It also establishes a rebate program for qualifying households, funded by transfers from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, to offset higher energy costs, with rebates capped at $2,500 per household and income eligibility limits. The bill further prohibits the adoption or expansion of fixed utility charges after January 1, 2026, and requires a study on the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the cost of living, with recommendations for broader application."
