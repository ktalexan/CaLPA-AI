billType: Assembly Bill
billYear: 2024
legislativeBody: California Legislature
legislativePeriod: 2023-2024
topic: "AB-2885: Artificial intelligence."
title': "AB-2885: An act to amend Section 22675 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 75002 of the Education Code, and to amend Sections 11546.45.5, 11547.5, and 53083.1 of the Government Code, relating to artificial intelligence."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 2885 (Chapter 843) amends several sections of California law to provide a unified definition of 'artificial intelligence' as an engineered or machine-based system capable of inferring from input how to generate outputs that influence environments. The bill updates various statutes to reference this definition, including those relating to government oversight of high-risk automated decision systems, reporting and mitigation of deepfakes and digital content forgeries, economic development subsidies (with reporting requirements on job loss or replacement due to AI and automation), and the use of AI in educational programs at the California Online Community College. It also ensures that social media companies report on their use of AI in content moderation and clarifies public transparency and accountability measures regarding the impact of AI technologies across state and local agencies."
