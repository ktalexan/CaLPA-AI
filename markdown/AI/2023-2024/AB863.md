topic: "AB-863: Carpet recycling: producer responsibility organizations: fines: succession: training."
title': "AB-863: An act to amend Sections 42972 and 42978 of, to add Sections 42972.3, 42973.7, 42973.9, 42980, and 42983.5 to, and to add Chapter 19.5 (commencing with Section 42968) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to recycling."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 863 (Chapter 675) overhauls California's carpet recycling program by establishing a producer responsibility organization (PRO) that all carpet producers must join to manage the collection, recycling, and proper disposal of carpet products statewide. The bill mandates detailed producer responsibility plans, performance standards, public outreach, annual audits, and transparent reporting, with increased penalties for noncompliance (up to $25,000/day for intentional violations). It requires 8% of collected assessments to fund apprenticeship training for carpet installers, mandates recycled content in carpets, and prohibits delegation of board responsibilities outside the PRO's directors. The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery is empowered to audit, regulate, and enforce compliance, while certain financial and business data are protected from public disclosure. The bill phases out the previous stewardship program once new regulations and plans are in place and clarifies that no state reimbursement is required for local compliance costs."
