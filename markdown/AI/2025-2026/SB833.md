summary: "Senate Bill 833, introduced by Senator McNerney in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, would require state agencies operating critical infrastructure to implement human oversight mechanisms for any deployed artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

The Department of Technology would provide specialized training in AI safety and risk management to oversight personnel. Additionally, agencies would be required to conduct annual assessments of their AI and automated decision systems, evaluating compliance, safety, and potential risks, and submit summaries of these assessments to the department."
