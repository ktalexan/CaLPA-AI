summary: "Assembly Bill 512, introduced by Assembly Member Harabedian, amends California law to require health care service plans and disability insurers to make prior authorization decisions for health care services more quickly—within 48 hours for standard requests and 24 hours for urgent requests—after receiving necessary information. The bill also establishes requirements for the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, or software tools in utilization review, ensuring such tools do not make final medical necessity determinations (which must be made by licensed professionals), do not discriminate, and protect patient data. The bill does not require state reimbursement to local agencies and imposes administrative penalties for noncompliance."
