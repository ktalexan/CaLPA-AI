summary: "Assembly Bill No. 723, introduced by Assembly Member Pellerin in California's 2025–2026 legislative session, would require real estate brokers and salespersons to clearly disclose when images in advertisements or promotional materials for property sales have been digitally altered using photo editing software or artificial intelligence to add, remove, or change elements of the property (such as furniture, appliances, or walls). For online ads, the unaltered version of the image must also be provided or linked. The bill excludes standard photo adjustments (like lighting or cropping) from these requirements. Violations would constitute a crime, but no state reimbursement to local agencies is required under this act."
