title': "AB-1027: An act to amend Sections 22677 and 22945 of, and to add and repeal Sections 22945.7 and 22945.9 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to social media platforms."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 1027 (Chapter 824), approved in October 2023, amends California law to require social media platforms to enhance transparency and reporting regarding policies and actions taken to address the illegal distribution of controlled substances. The bill mandates that platforms submit detailed semiannual reports to the Attorney General—including information on content moderation, flagged and actioned content (now explicitly covering controlled substances), and how automated and human review systems are used. The law removes the previous exemption for smaller companies, requires platforms to retain removed content related to controlled substances for 90 days (with exceptions for lawful gender-affirming and reproductive health care), and obliges platforms to publish clear policy statements on their practices, retention policies, and cooperation with law enforcement. These requirements do not override existing privacy laws and are set to expire on January 1, 2028."
