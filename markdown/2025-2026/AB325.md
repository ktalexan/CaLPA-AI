summary: "Assembly Bill 325, introduced by Assembly Member Aguiar-Curry in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, amends the Cartwright Act to address the use of pricing algorithms in business practices. The bill makes it unlawful for a person to use or distribute a 'common pricing algorithm'—including those utilizing artificial intelligence or machine learning—to set or recommend prices or commercial terms if they know or should know the algorithm is or will be used by others for similar purposes within California. The bill also clarifies that, in complaints for Cartwright Act violations, it is sufficient to allege plausible existence of anti-competitive agreements without needing to exclude independent action. Violations would expand criminal liability, but no state reimbursement to local agencies is required."
