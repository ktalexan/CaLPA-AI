It prohibits retaliation against consumers for exercising their privacy rights, sets requirements for contracts with service providers, and gives the Insurance Commissioner authority to investigate violations and impose penalties. The bill also includes specific protections for sensitive information, such as biometric and health data, and ensures transparency, oversight, and accountability in insurance data practices."
