summary: "Senate Bill 721, introduced by Senator Becker in the 2023–2024 California legislative session, amends Section 65400 of the Government Code to require cities and counties, starting with the 7th housing element revision, to include the number of suite-style student housing quarters in their annual housing reports to the Department of Housing and Community Development. These quarters must meet specific requirements (e.g., kitchen facilities, bathroom ratios, health and safety standards) and may count toward no more than 25% of any income category in meeting regional housing needs. The bill imposes a state-mandated local program but specifies that no state reimbursement is required, as local agencies can cover costs through service charges or fees."
