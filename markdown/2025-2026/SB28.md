summary: "Senate Bill 28, introduced by Senator Umberg, amends California's Health and Safety Code to require that treatment court programs be made available to all eligible defendants statewide, aligning these programs with state and nationally recognized best practices, including those developed by All Rise.

It removes the requirement for the Judicial Council to revise standards, instead ensuring that existing judicial standards are followed for treatment programs, especially for those eligible under the newly enacted Treatment-Mandated Felony Act (Proposition 36, 2024). The act is declared urgent and will take immediate effect to facilitate the prompt implementation of Proposition 36."
