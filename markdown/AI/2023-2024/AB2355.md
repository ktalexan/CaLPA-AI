summary: "Assembly Bill No. 2355 (Chapter 260) amends the Political Reform Act of 1974 to require that any political advertisement in California that contains images, audio, or video generated or substantially altered by artificial intelligence (AI) must include a clear disclosure stating 'Ad generated or substantially altered using artificial intelligence.' The bill defines what constitutes AI-generated or altered content and prescribes specific formatting for these disclosures based on the advertisement's medium (radio, TV, print, electronic media, etc.). Enforcement is handled by the Fair Political Practices Commission, which may seek injunctive relief or other administrative/civil remedies for violations, though such violations are not considered misdemeanors. The bill aims to increase transparency in political advertising as AI technologies become more prevalent."
