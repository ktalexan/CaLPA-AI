summary: "Senate Bill 833, introduced by Senator McNerney in the California Legislature, would require state agencies operating critical infrastructure that use artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision systems to implement human oversight mechanisms, including real-time monitoring and pre-approval of AI actions, except in cases where such oversight would destabilize essential systems. The bill mandates specialized AI safety and risk management training for oversight personnel, annual assessments of AI systems for compliance, safety, and risk (including mass casualty risks), and submission of assessment summaries to the Department of Technology. The bill aims to strengthen safeguards and accountability for AI use in vital state infrastructure sectors such as transportation, energy, communications, and emergency services."
