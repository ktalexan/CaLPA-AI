summary: "Senate Bill 771, introduced by Senator Stern in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, would add new provisions to the Civil Code making large social media platforms (those earning over $100 million annually) civilly liable if they violate existing California laws against hate crimes, intimidation, or discrimination, including via their algorithms or artificial intelligence systems that relay harmful content. The bill cites rising hate crimes and online harassment targeting minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and women, and asserts that platforms could face significant financial penalties—up to three months’ gross revenue per violation, with higher penalties if minors are involved. The legislation clarifies that social media companies can be held responsible for aiding, abetting, or conspiring in such violations, and that algorithmic content recommendations are independent acts for which platforms have actual knowledge and responsibility."
