topic: "AB-863: Carpet recycling: producer responsibility organizations: fines: succession: training."
title': "AB-863: An act to amend Sections 42972 and 42978 of, to add Sections 42972.3, 42973.7, 42973.9, 42980, and 42983.5 to, and to add Chapter 19.5 (commencing with Section 42968) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to recycling."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 863 (Chapter 675) overhauls California's carpet recycling program by establishing a new producer responsibility framework. It requires carpet producers to join a single Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) responsible for developing, funding, and implementing a comprehensive plan for the collection, transportation, recycling, and safe management of carpet products in the state. The bill mandates the inclusion of nonvoting board members from environmental NGOs, retailers, and labor representatives, and allocates 8% of collected assessments to apprenticeship training grants. The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery is empowered to audit organizations, enforce compliance, and impose increased penalties for violations (up to $25,000 per day for intentional breaches). The bill also introduces stricter reporting, transparency, and public outreach requirements, sets recycled content and labeling standards, and renames existing stewardship accounts. Public access to sensitive business data is restricted, and the act provides antitrust immunity for certain collaborative actions by producers. The new program will replace the existing stewardship structure once regulatory and planning milestones are met."
