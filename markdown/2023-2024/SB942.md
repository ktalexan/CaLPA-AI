summary: "Senate Bill No. 942, the California AI Transparency Act, requires large providers of generative AI systems in California to make free, publicly accessible AI detection tools available, and to offer clear, permanent disclosures on AI-generated or altered content. The law mandates both visible (manifest) and embedded (latent) disclosures that identify content as AI-generated and provide provenance information, where technically feasible. Covered providers must also ensure licensees maintain these disclosure capabilities and revoke licenses if they are disabled. Violations can result in civil penalties of $5,000 per violation, with enforcement by the Attorney General or local officials. The Act exempts certain entertainment and non-user-generated content and becomes operative on January 1, 2026."
