summary: "Assembly Bill 3211, introduced by Assembly Member Wicks, establishes the California Digital Content Provenance Standards, requiring generative AI providers to attach robust provenance data to synthetic content, conduct adversarial testing, and provide public detection tools. The bill also mandates that newly manufactured recording devices offer users the option to embed difficult-to-remove provenance data in nonsynthetic content, and that large online platforms label and disclose provenance information for synthetic content, including special requirements for music and video. Platforms must report annually on their moderation of deceptive synthetic content. The Department of Technology is authorized to impose administrative penalties (up to $100,000 per intentional or grossly negligent violation) and manage collected funds for enforcement. The provisions take effect July 1, 2026, aiming to reduce harms from deepfakes and increase transparency in digital content."
