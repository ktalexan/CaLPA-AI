summary: "Assembly Bill 459, introduced by Assembly Member Kalra, amends Section 12525.5 of the California Government Code to update reporting requirements for law enforcement stop data. The bill requires state and local agencies employing peace officers to submit annual stop data to the Attorney General by March 1, with semiannual reporting required if issues are found. It limits public access to open text or narrative fields containing potentially personally identifiable information, making such data available only from the reporting agency, while allowing the Attorney General to provide full data sets (including narrative fields) to approved educational, advocacy, or research entities under strict confidentiality rules. The legislation aims to balance transparency with privacy protections and includes provisions for state reimbursement of mandated local costs."
