summary: "Senate Bill No. 1120, approved in September 2024, amends California's Health and Safety and Insurance Codes to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms, and software tools in health care utilization review and management by health plans and insurers. The bill requires that any AI or algorithm used must base determinations on individual clinical information, not solely on group data, and must not supplant provider decision-making or discriminate against enrollees. Only licensed physicians or qualified health professionals can ultimately deny, delay, or modify health care services based on medical necessity. The law mandates transparency, periodic review, and compliance with state and federal regulations, and provides for administrative penalties for violations. No state reimbursement to local agencies is required as a result of this act."
