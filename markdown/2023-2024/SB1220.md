summary: "Senate Bill 1220, introduced by Senator Limón, requires that until July 1, 2030, all state and local contracts for call centers serving California public benefit programs must use workers employed in California, and prohibits the use of artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision systems (ADS) to eliminate or automate core job functions of call center workers. Agencies must notify workers and the public if AI or ADS impacting core job functions are used, and contractors must certify compliance. The bill extends these requirements to local agencies, eliminates certain exceptions, and provides for penalties and contract termination for noncompliance, with some exemptions for emergencies, prior contracts, and specific health-related entities. The legislation aims to protect California jobs and applies statewide, including charter cities, with provisions for local agency reimbursement if state mandates impose costs."
