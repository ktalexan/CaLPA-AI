summary: "Senate Bill 299, introduced by Senator Cabaldon in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, proposes changes to local government procedures for passing ordinances and amending zoning laws. The bill would require counties and cities to wait five days after publication, rather than introduction, before passing most ordinances, while still allowing urgency ordinances to be passed immediately. It removes several procedural requirements for ordinance passage and allows local governments to use a streamlined, ministerial approval process when amending zoning ordinances to comply with updated general plans. This streamlining would expand exemptions under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for certain housing developments, making it easier for local agencies to approve projects consistent with updated general plans."
