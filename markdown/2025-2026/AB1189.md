topic: "AB-1189: Court reporting: digital reporters and legal transcriptionists."
title': "AB-1189: An act to amend Section 8031 of, to add Section 8019.5 to, and to add Article 6 (commencing with Section 8060) and Article 7 (commencing with Section 8070) to Chapter 13 of Division 3 of, the Business and Professions Code, to amend Sections 2025.330 and 2025.510 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to add Section 1295 to the Evidence Code, and to amend Section 69957 of, and to add Section 69954.5 to, the Government Code, relating to court reporting, and making an appropriation therefor."
summary: "California Assembly Bill 1189 (2025) proposes to expand the regulation of court reporting by establishing certification for digital reporters and legal transcriptionists, alongside existing shorthand reporters. Certified digital reporters would be authorized to swear in witnesses and digitally capture legal proceedings, while legal transcriptionists would be able to transcribe and certify transcripts for legal use. The bill outlines qualifications, fees, and duties for these new roles and prohibits courts from replacing certified shorthand reporters with digital reporters or transcriptionists as an unfair labor practice. It also updates laws to allow depositions and court proceedings to be recorded and transcribed digitally under certain conditions, ensures admissibility of digital transcripts, and requires that transcripts from digital recordings be prepared by certified legal transcriptionists. The bill includes appropriations and expands the scope of existing crimes, thereby creating a state-mandated local program."
