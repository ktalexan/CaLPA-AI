summary: "Assembly Bill 2412, introduced by Assembly Member Reyes, proposes the California Body Contouring Practitioner Act to regulate noninvasive, nonmedical body contouring services in California. The bill would create the California Body Contouring Council to oversee certification, permitting, and education for practitioners, requiring completion of a 200-hour, physician-approved online course and annual continuing education. The council would issue permits for practitioners, premises, and mobile units, all subject to annual renewal and inspection, and would enforce ethical standards and legal scope of practice. The act prohibits the use of medical devices, false advertising of certification, and establishes a public registry and complaint process, aiming to enhance consumer safety, provide standardized training, and prevent unregulated practices in the growing body contouring industry."
