summary: "Senate Bill 37, introduced by Senator Umberg for the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes amendments to the Business and Professions Code regarding attorney advertising and solicitation.

It also allows any person (or, in the case of deceptive advertising, any misled consumer) to bring civil actions for violations, with statutory damages ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per violation, plus attorney fees and other relief, and requires courts to consider the seriousness and persistence of misconduct in awarding damages."
