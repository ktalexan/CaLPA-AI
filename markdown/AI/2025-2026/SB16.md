summary: "Senate Bill 16 (2025-2026), introduced by Senator Blakespear, amends California's housing and homelessness laws to require cities and counties—especially those not receiving Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prevention (HHAP) funding—to include updated data and actionable plans for reducing and preventing homelessness in their housing elements. The bill mandates a coordinated assessment and 10-year financing plan by the Department of Housing and Community Development to address unsheltered and chronic homelessness, requiring consultation with stakeholders and regular reporting to the Legislature. It also clarifies the roles of state and local governments in data collection, planning, and service delivery, and ensures that any state-mandated costs are reimbursed to local agencies. The changes apply to all California cities, including charter cities."
