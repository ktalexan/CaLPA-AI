The bill mandates real-time monitoring and approval of AI actions by humans, specialized AI safety training for oversight personnel, and annual assessments of AI systems to evaluate compliance, performance, and risks, with findings reported to the Department of Technology. The law aims to enhance safety and accountability in state-managed critical infrastructure sectors such as transportation, energy, and emergency services, while exempting certain existing systems where oversight would pose immediate risks."
