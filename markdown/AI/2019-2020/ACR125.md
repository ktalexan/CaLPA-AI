summary: "The California Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 125, introduced in August 2019, highlights persistent employment discrimination against minority groups despite existing anti-discrimination laws, and notes the limitations and biases in current hiring practices such as résumé reviews and elite college recruiting. Citing research on continued disparities for Black and Latino applicants and underrepresentation of low-income and minority students at top universities, the resolution recognizes the potential of innovative technologies, including artificial intelligence, to reduce bias in hiring and promotion. It urges policymakers to promote the development and use of such technologies to ensure fair employment opportunities and reduce discrimination, positioning California as a leader in setting appropriate standards."
