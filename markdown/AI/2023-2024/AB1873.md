summary: "California Assembly Bill 1873, introduced by Assembly Member Sanchez in January 2024, proposes to amend Section 311.3 of the Penal Code to make it a crime to knowingly develop, duplicate, print, or exchange any information, data, or image generated using artificial intelligence that depicts a person under 18 engaged in sexual conduct. This expands existing law, which already criminalizes such acts involving real or computer-generated images, to include AI-generated content. Violations can be prosecuted as misdemeanors or felonies, and certain exceptions apply, such as activities by law enforcement or for legitimate medical, scientific, or educational purposes. The bill specifies that no state reimbursement to local agencies is required due to the creation of a new crime."
