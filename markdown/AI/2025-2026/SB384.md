Sellers may claim an affirmative defense if they can show due diligence in ensuring compliance. Violations can result in civil actions brought by the Attorney General or local prosecutors, with penalties of up to $1,000 per violation and the possibility of injunctive relief, restitution, and attorney’s fees. The bill specifically defines key terms such as 'artificial intelligence,' 'nonpublic input data,' 'price-fixing algorithm,' and 'seller.'"
