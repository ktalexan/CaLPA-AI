summary: "Senate Bill 1047, the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, establishes new regulations for developers and operators of advanced AI models in California. It requires developers of large-scale AI models (those exceeding certain compute and cost thresholds) to implement rigorous safety and security protocols, conduct independent annual audits, report AI safety incidents, and submit compliance statements to the Attorney General. Operators of large computing clusters must also verify customers' intent and retain records. The bill prohibits the release or use of covered AI models if they pose unreasonable risks of critical harm, such as enabling mass casualty events or major cyberattacks. Whistleblower protections are included, and violations can lead to significant civil penalties. The Act also creates a Board of Frontier Models to oversee regulations and a consortium to plan a public cloud resource, CalCompute, to foster safe and equitable AI research. Certain information is exempt from public disclosure to protect safety and proprietary interests."
