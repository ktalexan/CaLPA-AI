summary: "Senate Bill 57, the Ratepayer and Technological Innovation Protection Act, introduced by Senator Padilla in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, directs the Public Utilities Commission to establish or modify a special tariff for large electricity users (eligible customers with at least 50 MW demand and 50 kV transmission-level service) by July 1, 2026. The bill aims to support the growing energy needs of technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence and large data centers, while ensuring that existing utility customers are not burdened by cost shifts, rates remain just and reasonable, and grid investments are recovered from these large users if they underutilize or cease operations. The commission may require distributed energy storage and backup systems to help meet emission reduction goals, and may set zero-carbon procurement requirements. The bill creates new criminal liability for violations but does not require state reimbursement to local agencies."
