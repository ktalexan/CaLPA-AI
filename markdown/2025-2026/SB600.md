summary: "Senate Bill 600, introduced by Senator Cortese in the 2025–2026 California Legislature, proposes to amend Section 3541.3 of the Government Code to specifically authorize the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to conduct studies on the impact of net-zero carbon emissions initiatives on public employees. The bill expands PERB's existing authority to collect, analyze, and make available data related to employer-employee relations by including the effects of net-zero initiatives, with the goal of informing policy and potential legislation. Other board powers and duties remain unchanged, and the bill does not require appropriations or create a local program but does have fiscal implications."
