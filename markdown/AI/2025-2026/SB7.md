summary: "Senate Bill No. 7, introduced in California's 2025-2026 session, would regulate employers' use of automated decision systems (ADS) in employment-related decisions.

Employers are prohibited from using ADS for certain sensitive functions, must involve human reviewers in major employment decisions, and allow workers to access and correct their data. Workers affected by ADS decisions have the right to appeal, with a required human review process and deadlines for responses and rectification. The bill prohibits retaliation against workers asserting these rights, establishes enforcement by the Labor Commissioner, and allows civil actions with penalties for violations."
