summary: "Senate Bill 721, introduced by Senator Becker in California's 2023–2024 legislative session, amends Section 65400 of the Government Code to require cities and counties, starting with the seventh revision of their housing element, to include in their annual land use reports the number of suite-style student housing quarters that meet specific standards (such as kitchen facilities and bathroom ratios) among demolished and new housing units. These suite-style student housing quarters can count toward meeting a jurisdiction's regional housing needs, but not for more than 25% of any income category. The bill imposes a new local reporting requirement but specifies that no state reimbursement is needed as local agencies can cover related costs."
