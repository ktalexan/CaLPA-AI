These programs must include regular risk assessments, employee training, secure access controls, encryption, and policies for third-party service providers. Violations would be considered deceptive trade practices under existing law, and the California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to adopt implementing regulations. The bill is intended to further the purposes of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."
