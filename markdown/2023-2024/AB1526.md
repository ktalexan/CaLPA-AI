title': "AB-1526: An act to amend Sections 3114, 3206.2, 4584, 42040, 42041, 42051.1, 42053, 42061, 42064, 42064.01, 42067, 42081, 42464.3, 48701, 48703, and 48705 of, and to add Section 48707 to, the Public Resources Code, relating to public resources."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 1526 (Chapter 848, approved October 13, 2023) makes numerous amendments to California's Public Resources Code, extending and updating reporting requirements and deadlines for programs on underground injection control and fugitive emissions from idle oil and gas wells, expanding the Forest Practice Act's waiver process for certain timber operations, and revising the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act to strengthen recycling, composting, and source reduction requirements for single-use packaging and food service ware. The bill refines definitions, mandates mechanisms for local funding transfers, updates compliance and enforcement provisions, and recasts the plastic pollution fund surcharge as an "environmental mitigation surcharge" with new collection and dispute procedures. Additionally, it brings aerosol spray paint under the architectural paint recovery program, outlines detailed reporting requirements, and authorizes regulatory clarifications. The bill clarifies that no state reimbursement is required for local costs, as these changes relate to crimes or infractions."
