summary: "Assembly Bill No. 1054, introduced by Assembly Member Gipson in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes to establish a voluntary Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) within the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) for members of State Bargaining Units 5 (Highway Patrol) and 8 (Firefighters). The bill aims to address recruitment and retention challenges in the California Highway Patrol and CAL FIRE by allowing eligible employees who would otherwise retire to remain on the job for an additional one to five years, receiving retirement benefits in a lump sum or monthly payments upon retirement. The program, subject to collective bargaining and required to be cost-neutral or result in cost savings, would be funded entirely by participant contributions and is modeled after similar programs successfully used by other public safety agencies in California."
