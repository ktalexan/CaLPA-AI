topic: "SB-294: Health care coverage: independent medical review."
title': "SB-294: An act to add Sections 1368.012 and 1374.37 to the Health and Safety Code, and to add Sections 10169.4 and 10169.6 to the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage."
summary: "Senate Bill 294, introduced by Senator Wiener and coauthors, amends California's health care laws to require that, starting January 1, 2026, health care service plans and disability insurers must automatically submit, within 24 hours, any decision to modify, delay, or deny mental health or substance use disorder treatment for individuals up to age 26 to the Independent Medical Review System if the decision is unresolved after the standard grievance process. This automatic submission aims to improve access to mental health care, especially for youth and vulnerable populations, by removing the burden from patients to initiate the review. The bill excludes Medi-Cal managed care plans, allows for regulatory guidance by relevant authorities, and mandates public reporting on review outcomes, but does not require state reimbursement to local agencies as any costs stem from changes to criminal provisions."
