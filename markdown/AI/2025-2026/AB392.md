summary: "Assembly Bill No. 392, introduced by Assembly Member Dixon in California's 2025–2026 legislative session, seeks to regulate pornographic internet websites by requiring operators to ensure that any uploaded sexually explicit content does not include individuals who did not consent, were minors at the time of creation, or did not consent to the content being uploaded. Users must submit a statement under penalty of perjury affirming consent and age of all depicted individuals before uploading such content. Operators must remove content within 48 hours if notified of lack of consent or minor status, with daily violations penalized. The bill allows depicted individuals and public prosecutors to pursue civil actions for violations, provides for damages and penalties, and clarifies that no state reimbursement is required for local agencies due to the creation of new crimes or infractions."
