summary: "Senate Bill 481, introduced by Senator Alvarado-Gil in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes technical, nonsubstantive amendments to Section 12300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, which governs the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program. The IHSS program enables qualified aged, blind, and disabled individuals to receive supportive services—including personal care, domestic help, paramedical services, and respite care—allowing them to remain safely in their homes. The bill clarifies definitions and eligibility, ensures services can be provided in certain locations like workplaces under specific conditions, and maintains existing limits and reimbursement rates, but does not make substantive policy changes."
