summary: "Assembly Bill No. 882, introduced by Assembly Member Papan in the 2025–2026 California Legislature, temporarily allows superior courts facing a shortage of court reporters to authorize electronic recording of proceedings in family law, probate, and civil contempt cases, under strict conditions and oversight, until January 1, 2028. The bill prohibits the Judicial Council from approving new purchases or leases of electronic recording equipment solely for monitoring subordinate judicial officers, and mandates that transcripts from such recordings indicate any inaudible or unintelligible portions. Courts must make ongoing efforts to hire certified shorthand reporters, maintain transparency in hiring practices, and cannot displace current reporters without consent. The act is deemed urgent and takes immediate effect to address the court reporter shortage crisis."
