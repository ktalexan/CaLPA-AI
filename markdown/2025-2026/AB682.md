summary: "Assembly Bill 682, introduced in the California Legislature for the 2025–2026 session, would require health care service plans and health insurers to include detailed monthly data on claims processing, denials (including reasons and costs), appeals, and the use of artificial intelligence in their existing financial and enrollment reports.
