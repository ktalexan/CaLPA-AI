summary: "Senate Bill No. 1120 (Chapter 879), approved on September 28, 2024, amends California's Health and Safety Code and Insurance Code to regulate the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, or other software tools in health care utilization review and management by health care service plans and disability insurers.

The law mandates transparency, non-discrimination, periodic review, and compliance with state and federal laws, and subjects plans and insurers to administrative penalties for violations. The bill does not require state reimbursement to local agencies for any costs incurred."
