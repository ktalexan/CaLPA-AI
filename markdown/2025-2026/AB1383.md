topic: "AB-1383: Public employees’ retirement benefits."
title': "AB-1383: An act to amend Sections 7522.10, 7522.25, and 7522.30 of, and to add Sections 7522.19 and 7522.26 to, the Government Code, relating to public employees’ retirement, and making an appropriation therefor."
summary: "Assembly Bill 1383, introduced by Assembly Member McKinnor for the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes significant changes to public employees’ retirement benefits, particularly for safety workers like firefighters and police officers. Effective January 1, 2026, the bill aligns pensionable compensation limits with federal standards, establishes new and more generous retirement formulas for safety members (including options up to 3% at age 55), and allows employers and employees to negotiate higher or lower benefit plans through collective bargaining. The bill also permits employers to pay a portion of employee pension contributions, reversing a key restriction of the 2013 Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act (PEPRA). These reforms aim to address recruitment and retention challenges, reflect the unique risks and demands of safety professions, and maintain the sustainability of the retirement system, while ensuring that accrued benefits before the law's effective date are protected."
