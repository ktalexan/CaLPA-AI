billType: Senate Bill
billYear: 2024
legislativeBody: California Legislature
legislativePeriod: 2023-2024
topic: "SB-1120: Health care coverage: utilization review."
title': "SB-1120: An act to amend Section 1367.01 of the Health and Safety Code, and to amend Section 10123.135 of the Insurance Code, relating to health care coverage."
summary: "Senate Bill 1120, approved in September 2024, amends California law to require that health care service plans and disability insurers using artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms, or software tools for utilization review or management must ensure these tools base decisions on individual patient clinical information, do not rely solely on group data, are fairly and equitably applied, and do not replace health care provider decision-making. AI tools cannot independently deny, delay, or modify care based on medical necessity—such determinations must be made by a licensed physician or qualified health professional. The bill also imposes compliance, transparency, and audit requirements for the use of AI in these processes, prohibits discrimination, and ensures patient data privacy, with penalties for noncompliance. No state reimbursement is required for local agencies due to this act."
