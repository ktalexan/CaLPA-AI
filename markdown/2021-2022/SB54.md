title': "SB-54: An act to amend Section 41821.5 of, to add Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 42040) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, and to repeal Section 42064 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to solid waste."
summary: "Senate Bill 54 (Chapter 75, 2022) establishes the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act in California, requiring producers of certain single-use packaging and plastic food service ware to reduce plastic waste, ensure recyclability or compostability by 2032, and meet specified recycling rates (65% by 2032). Producers must join or individually comply with a Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) that manages source reduction, collection, processing, and recycling, and must pay fees to cover program costs, state administration, and a $500 million annual environmental mitigation surcharge (2027–2037) to fund plastic pollution mitigation, with a portion benefiting disadvantaged communities. The Act mandates comprehensive reporting, auditing, and public oversight, sets up an advisory board, and enforces compliance through penalties up to $50,000 per day. It requires ongoing state needs assessments, regular updates to recyclable/compostable material lists, and prohibits certain uses of funds (e.g., incineration, lobbying). The bill also includes confidentiality provisions for proprietary business data and outlines funding, reporting, and enforcement mechanisms to achieve a circular economy for packaging materials."
