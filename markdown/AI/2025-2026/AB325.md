summary: "California Assembly Bill 325, introduced by Assembly Member Aguiar-Curry, amends the Cartwright Act to strengthen antitrust enforcement, particularly regarding the use of pricing algorithms. The bill prohibits using or distributing pricing algorithms trained with nonpublic competitor data, and restricts the use of other data-driven pricing algorithms in ways that could facilitate anti-competitive behavior across markets. It clarifies that complaints under the Cartwright Act need only plausibly allege a contract, trust, or conspiracy to restrain trade, without excluding the possibility of independent action. The bill expands criminal liability for violations but specifies that no state reimbursement to local agencies is required, as any costs arise from changes to criminal law."
