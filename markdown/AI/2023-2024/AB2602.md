summary: "Assembly Bill No. 2602 (Chapter 259), approved on September 17, 2024, adds Section 927 to the California Labor Code to address the use of digital replicas—computer-generated, highly realistic representations of an individual's voice or likeness—in personal or professional service contracts. Effective January 1, 2025, contractual provisions allowing for the use of a digital replica in lieu of the individual's actual work are unenforceable unless they include a specific description of intended uses or meet certain requirements, such as negotiation by legal counsel or inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement. The law aims to protect individuals from unauthorized or vaguely defined uses of their digital likenesses while excluding standard copyright practices such as remixing or remastering."
