title': "AB-1242: An act to amend Sections 7295.2, 7295.4, 7296.2, 7299.3, 7299.4, and 7299.6 of the Government Code, and to add Division 115 (commencing with Section 135000) to the Health and Safety Code, relating to language access."
summary: "Assembly Bill 1242, introduced by Assembly Member Nguyen in California's 2025–2026 session, amends the Government Code and Health and Safety Code to strengthen and expand language access requirements for state agencies. The bill revises definitions and mandates agencies to provide translated materials and services not only to those served but also to those eligible to be served, based on the needs of non-English-speaking and limited-English-speaking populations. Agencies must use recent census and community data to assess language needs, conduct biennial surveys, and develop implementation plans addressing deficiencies. The bill establishes a Language Access Director within the California Health and Human Services Agency to oversee the creation and execution of Language Access Plans, ensure the use of qualified translators and interpreters (with restrictions on machine or AI translation unless human-reviewed), and coordinate with departments to improve access for individuals with limited English proficiency and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Regular reporting to the Legislature is required, and dedicated funding is allocated for these initiatives."
