summary: "Senate Bill No. 1223 amends California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to expand the definition of 'sensitive personal information' to include 'neural data,' which is information generated by measuring the activity of a consumer's central or peripheral nervous system, not inferred from nonneural information. This change enhances consumer privacy protections by requiring businesses to treat neural data with the same strict standards as other sensitive data, such as biometric or health information, and allows consumers to limit its use. The bill affirms its alignment with the purposes of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 and specifies how it will interact with other pending legislation."
