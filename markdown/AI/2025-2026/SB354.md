summary: "Senate Bill 354, the Insurance Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2025, introduced by Senator Limón, establishes comprehensive privacy standards for the collection, processing, retention, and sharing of Californians' personal information by insurance licensees and their third-party service providers. The bill builds on the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), addressing gaps specific to the insurance industry by requiring clear privacy notices, limiting data collection and retention, mandating consumer consent for non-insurance uses, and prohibiting retaliation against consumers exercising their rights. Consumers gain rights to access, correct, or delete their information, and to receive notice of adverse underwriting decisions. The Insurance Commissioner is empowered to investigate violations, issue cease and desist orders, and impose significant fines. The bill also imposes strict contractual and security requirements on third-party service providers, prohibits the sale of personal information, and creates criminal penalties for obtaining information under false pretenses. Certain internal compliance documents are protected from public disclosure, and the act preempts inconsistent state laws but not federal health information laws."
