summary: "Senate Bill 468, introduced in California's 2025–2026 legislative session by Senator Becker, would require businesses that deploy high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) systems processing personal information to implement comprehensive information security programs with specific administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. The bill defines covered deployers and high-risk AI systems, mandates regular risk assessments, employee training, third-party oversight, encryption, and incident response protocols, and aligns these requirements with existing state and federal privacy laws. Violations would be considered deceptive trade practices under California's Unfair Competition Law. The California Privacy Protection Agency is authorized to adopt regulations to implement the bill, which is intended to further the goals of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 by strengthening consumer privacy protections in the context of AI."
