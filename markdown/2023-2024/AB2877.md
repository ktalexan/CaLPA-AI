If authorization is granted, the information must be deidentified and aggregated before use. The bill also updates definitions, strengthens privacy protections, and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of businesses, service providers, and the California Privacy Protection Agency, aligning with the purposes of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020."
