summary: "Assembly Bill No. 3339, introduced by Assembly Member Wicks as the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act (KIDS Act), aims to protect children under 16 in California from manipulative and potentially harmful online practices by imposing new requirements and restrictions on platforms directed to children. The bill prohibits features such as auto-play, push alerts, engagement badges, and design elements that encourage excessive use or purchases by children. It also bans the amplification or promotion of sexual, violent, exploitative, or wholly commercial content to minors, and restricts advertising practices like host-selling, native advertising, and branded content targeting children. Platforms must use age verification information only for that purpose and are subject to annual audits, with the Attorney General required to issue regulations and oversee compliance. Violations are considered unfair competition under California law."
