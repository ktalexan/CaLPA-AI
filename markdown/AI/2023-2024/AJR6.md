summary: "California Assembly Joint Resolution No. 6, introduced by Assembly Member Essayli in May 2023, urges the U.S. government to immediately pause the training of artificial intelligence systems more powerful than GPT-4 for at least six months. The resolution cites concerns about the risks posed by advanced AI, such as loss of control, job automation, misinformation, and threats to democracy, and emphasizes the lack of adequate planning and oversight. It calls for this moratorium to allow time to develop robust AI governance, safety protocols, and regulatory frameworks to ensure that future AI systems are safe, transparent, and beneficial to society."
