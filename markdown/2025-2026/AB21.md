title': "AB-21: An act to amend Sections 4360, 4910, 4920, 4935, 4950, 4955, 5100, 5105, 5120, 5145, 5200, 5205, 5230, and 5235 of, and to add Sections 4921 and 4941 to, the Civil Code, relating to common interest developments."
summary: "Assembly Bill 21 (2025), known as the Homeowner Association Accountability and Transparency Act, proposes significant amendments to California's Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act to enhance transparency, accountability, and member rights in homeowners association (HOA) governance. Key changes include requiring individual notice for rule changes, prohibiting board members from discussing association business outside authorized meetings, mandating agenda packet access and detailed meeting minutes, and requiring electronic recording of open board meetings. The bill also strengthens litigation and insurance disclosure requirements, expands members' rights to inspect records (with free electronic access), and facilitates legal recourse in both superior and small claims courts for violations. Election procedures are clarified, removing secret ballot requirements for operating rule amendments and ensuring no member is denied a ballot except for non-membership. The bill further updates definitions, record-keeping, and privacy protections, aiming to make HOA operations more open and fair for all members."
