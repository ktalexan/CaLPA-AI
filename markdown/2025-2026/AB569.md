summary: "Assembly Bill 569, introduced by Assembly Member Stefani in the 2025-2026 California legislative session, proposes an amendment to Section 7522.18 of the Government Code related to retirement benefits. The bill addresses the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA), which restricts public employers from offering supplemental defined benefit pension plans to new employee groups or after January 1, 2013. AB 569 would allow public employers to negotiate, through collective bargaining, over contributions for supplemental retirement benefits administered by or on behalf of exclusive bargaining representatives, but only within the existing limitations of PEPRA. The bill does not require a majority vote, appropriation, fiscal committee review, or a local program."
