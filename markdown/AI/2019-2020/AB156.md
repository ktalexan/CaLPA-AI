summary: "California Assembly Bill 156, introduced by Assembly Member Voepel and amended in January 2020, modifies the Business and Professions Code relating to optometrists by establishing an endorsement fee of $50, which the State Board of Optometry may increase up to $100. The bill originally included significant provisions to regulate remote eye assessments and the use of assessment mechanisms—including artificial intelligence—for prescribing contact lenses and visual aid glasses, but these sections were removed in the amended version.
