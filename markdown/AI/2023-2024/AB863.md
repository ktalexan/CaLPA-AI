title': "AB-863: An act to amend Sections 42972 and 42978 of, to add Sections 42972.3, 42973.7, 42973.9, 42980, and 42983.5 to, and to add Chapter 19.5 (commencing with Section 42968) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to recycling."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 863 updates California's carpet recycling laws by strengthening producer responsibility requirements. It mandates that carpet manufacturers join a single producer responsibility organization (PRO) to develop and implement a comprehensive recycling plan, including collection, transportation, and recycling of carpets. The bill introduces nonvoting board members from environmental, retail, and labor sectors, increases penalties for violations, and requires annual audits and reporting to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. It allocates 8% of collected assessments to apprenticeship training grants, requires public outreach, and sets minimum recycled content standards for carpets. The bill also renames relevant funds, restricts public access to sensitive business data, and provides antitrust immunity for PRO actions. Existing stewardship programs remain in effect until the new program is fully implemented."
