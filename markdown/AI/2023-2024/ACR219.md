summary: "The California Legislature's Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 219, introduced by Assembly Member Lowenthal in June 2024, urges social media platforms to universally adopt and protect a set of fundamental user rights outlined in the proposed California Social Media Users’ Bill of Rights. The resolution cites concerns over the spread of harmful content, disinformation, and the negative impact of social media on children and democracy, and calls for platforms to take greater responsibility in areas such as content moderation, election integrity, user privacy (especially for children), transparency around algorithms and AI, user data portability, clear terms of service, and restrictions on the use of user content for AI training without informed consent. The measure emphasizes the need for social media companies to prioritize user safety, privacy, and the reduction of algorithmic harms, particularly for young people."
