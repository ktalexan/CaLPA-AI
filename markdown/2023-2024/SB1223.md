summary: "Senate Bill No. 1223 amends the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to expand the definition of 'sensitive personal information' to include 'neural data,' which is defined as information generated by measuring the activity of a consumer’s central or peripheral nervous system, not inferred from non-neural sources. This change grants consumers additional privacy rights over their neural data, requiring businesses to limit its use to only what is necessary for providing requested goods or services or as authorized by regulations. The bill affirms that these provisions further the purposes of the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, and will only take effect in conjunction with certain amendments if related bills are enacted. The legislation reflects growing concerns about the privacy of data generated by emerging technologies such as brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence."
