summary: "Senate Bill 833, introduced by Senator McNerney in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, would require state agencies operating critical infrastructure to implement human oversight mechanisms for any deployed artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision systems. This includes real-time monitoring and human review and approval of any AI-proposed actions before execution, with exceptions to prevent destabilization of existing systems. The bill also mandates annual assessments of these AI systems for compliance, safety, and risk—including potential mass casualty events—with findings submitted to the Department of Technology, which is tasked with training oversight personnel in AI safety and risk management."
