topic: "AB-863: Carpet recycling: producer responsibility organizations: fines: succession: training."
title': "AB-863: An act to amend Sections 42972 and 42978 of, to add Sections 42972.3, 42973.7, 42973.9, 42980, and 42983.5 to, and to add Chapter 19.5 (commencing with Section 42968) to Part 3 of Division 30 of, the Public Resources Code, relating to recycling."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 863 (Chapter 675) reforms California's carpet recycling program by establishing a comprehensive producer responsibility framework. The bill requires carpet producers to join a single Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) that develops and implements a state-approved plan for the collection, recycling, and management of carpet products, with mandatory public outreach and regular reporting. The PRO must include nonvoting board members from environmental NGOs, retailers, and labor representatives, and allocate 8% of collected assessments to apprenticeship training grants. The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery is authorized to audit, regulate, and enforce compliance, with increased penalties for violations (up to $10,000 per day, or $25,000 for intentional violations). The bill also mandates transparency, periodic plan reviews, and restricts the use of funds, while protecting certain business data and providing antitrust immunity for program activities. The new program replaces the existing stewardship system once specific regulatory and legislative milestones are met."
