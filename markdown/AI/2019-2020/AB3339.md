summary: "Assembly Bill 3339, known as the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act (KIDS Act), aims to protect children under 16 online by prohibiting certain manipulative or harmful features and content on platforms directed to children, such as auto-play, push alerts, visible engagement metrics, and features encouraging excessive engagement or purchases. The bill also bans the promotion of sexual, violent, or exploitative content, host-selling, program-length advertisements, and targeted branded or native advertising to children. Platforms must use age verification data only for that purpose, and the Attorney General is required to establish regulations for compliance and conduct annual audits of the top 25 child-directed platforms. Violations are considered unfair competition under California law."
