# Copilot instructions for generating code and text

- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.

- When generating a tldr summary of a text or a web page:
  - Provide a single paragraph summary of the text or web page.
  - Avoid using bullet points or lists in the summary.
  - Avoid duplicates in the summary.
  - Ensure the summary is concise and captures the main points of the text or web page.
  - When summarizing a legislative bill, include the bill number and title in the summary.
  - In the code block add a comment before the summary with "TL;DR", include the bill number (when summarizing a legislative bill), the date of the summary, and "generated by Copilot".
  - If the text or web page is too long to summarize in a single paragraph, add a second paragraph with the remaining information.

- When generating a python function include a docstring that:
  - Provides a single sentence summary of the function's purpose, right next to the first three double quotes.
  - Add a description of the function in natural language, explaining what the function does and how it works.
  - Add the arguments with their types and a brief description of each argument. If the argument is optional, mention it, and include the default value.
  - Add the return type and a brief description of the return value.
  - If the function raises any exceptions, add a section for exceptions with the type of exception and a brief description of when it is raised.
  - Add an example of how to use the function, including the expected output.

- When generating code for lists, dictionaries, or other data structures, do not break them into multiple lines unless they are too long to fit in a single line. Use a single line for short lists or dictionaries, and only break them into multiple lines if necessary for readability.

- When generating code for a class, include a docstring that:
  - Provides a single sentence summary of the class's purpose, right next to the first three double quotes.
  - Add a description of the class in natural language, explaining what the class does and how it works.
  - Add the attributes with their types and a brief description of each attribute. If the attribute is optional, mention it, and include the default value.
  - Add the methods with their types and a brief description of each method. If the method is optional, mention it, and include the default value.
  - Add an example of how to use the class, including the expected output.
  - If the class raises any exceptions, add a section for exceptions with the type of exception and a brief description of when it is raised.

- In any code, make sure the correct naming conventions are used. Specifically:
  - Use `camelCase` for variable names and function names.
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names.
  - Use `camelCase` for constants.
  - Use `camelCase` for JSON keys and JavaScript variables.
  - Use `lowerCamelCase` for JavaScript functions and methods.
  - Use `camelCase` for Python functions and methods.
  - Use `PascalCase` for Python classes.
  - Use `camelCase` for Python variables and constants.
  - Use `PascalCase` for C# classes and methods.
  - Use `camelCase` for C# variables and constants.
  - Use `camelCase` for Java classes and methods.
  - Use `camelCase` for Java variables and constants
  - Use `camelCase` for R functions and methods.
  - Use `camelCase` for R variables and constants.
  - Use `camelCase` for data frame names and variables (including pandas data frames and R data frames).
  - Use `camelCase` for data frame columns and variables (including pandas data frames and R data frames).

- In Python, check for the order of imports and ensure they are in the correct order:
  - Standard library imports
  - Related third-party imports
  - Local application/library-specific imports
  - Within each group, imports could be imported together in a single line, but this setting is not required.

- Make sure always there is a space before and after an operator in Python code. For example, use `a + b` instead of `a+b`. This includes all operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, etc.
- In Python, if possible use `is` for comparison to `None` instead of `==`. For example, use `if variable is None:` instead of `if variable == None:`.
- In Python, if possible use `is` for comparison to `True` or `False` instead of `==`. For example, use `if variable is True:` instead of `if variable == True:`.

- In Jupyter notebooks, for markdown headings, use the following format:
  - For the main title (H1):
    - Wrap everything with: the following code snippet:

        ```markdown
        <div style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bold; color: goldenrod"><div style = "background-color:indigo"><center>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; font-weight: bold; color:goldenrod; border-top: 3px solid goldenrod; padding-top: 10px">Title Goes Here</h1>
        Subtitle Goes Here</div>
        <div style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; color: goldenrod; border-bottom: 3px solid goldenrod; padding-bottom: 20px">version and date</div>
        </center></div>
        ```

    - For section titles (H2), wrap everything with:

        ```markdown
        <h1 style="font-weight:bold; color:orangered; border-bottom: 2px solid orangered">section title here</h1>
        ```

    - For subsection titles (H3), wrap everything with:

      ```markdown
      <h2 style="font-weight:bold; color:dodgerblue; border-bottom: 1px solid dodgerblue; padding-left: 25px">subsection title here</h2>
      ```

- In all code, the default indentations should be 4 spaces. Tabs insert 4 spaces. Do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.
