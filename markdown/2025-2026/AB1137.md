summary: "Assembly Bill 1137, introduced in the California Legislature, amends existing laws to strengthen requirements for social media platforms in handling reports of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The bill removes the requirement that reporting users be depicted in the material, clarifies that the depicted individual must be a minor (including those depicted through digitization or artificial intelligence), and mandates that reporting mechanisms be clear and conspicuous. Reports must be reviewed via hash matching, with human review required if no hash match exists and the content is not blocked. Noncompliant platforms face civil penalties and liability to depicted individuals, and public attorneys may bring civil actions. The bill also requires social media platforms to undergo third-party audits and publicly release audit reports to maintain exemption from liability for facilitating commercial sexual exploitation. Penalties for violations are increased, and the bill's provisions are declared severable."
