summary: "The California Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 219, introduced by Assembly Member Lowenthal in June 2024, urges social media platforms to adopt and protect a 'California Social Media Users’ Bill of Rights.'

It also advocates for banning the use of user-generated content in AI training without explicit consent and encourages platforms to collaborate with independent experts to reduce harms, particularly to young people."
