summary: "Assembly Bill 1545, known as the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act (KIDS Act), aims to enhance online safety and privacy protections for children under 13 in California.

It requires platforms to provide parental controls, allow parents to create child accounts or profiles, and clearly distinguish commercial content. The Attorney General is mandated to conduct annual audits of platforms for compliance with state and federal child privacy laws, with violations constituting unfair competition. The legislation responds to concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, behavioral marketing, and manipulative online practices targeting children."
