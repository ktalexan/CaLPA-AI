Key changes affect personal and corporate income taxes, deductions, credits (including research and low-income housing), net operating losses, Roth IRAs, capital assets, and conformity with or exclusion from certain federal disaster and COVID-19 relief provisions. The bill repeals obsolete sections, adds new ones, and includes technical amendments to ensure state law reflects federal changes, but with California-specific differences where noted. Declared an urgency statute, the bill is intended to provide immediate tax relief and reduce administrative burdens by harmonizing state and federal tax rules for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2025."
