summary: "Senate Bill 1228, introduced by Senator Padilla in the California Legislature, would require large social media platforms (with at least 1,000,000 California users) to verify the identity of influential and highly influential users—those with significant reach or follower counts—by checking their name, phone, and email, and for highly influential users, by reviewing government-issued ID. Platforms must indicate on user profiles and posts whether these users are authenticated or unauthenticated, allow users to opt out of seeing unauthenticated content, and protect sensitive personal information. The bill authorizes legal action by the Attorney General or local authorities to enforce compliance, but does not require platforms to reduce visibility for unauthenticated users or limit their own additional verification policies."
