summary: "Assembly Bill 1067, introduced by Assembly Member Quirk-Silva in the California Legislature's 2025–2026 session, amends the Government Code to require public employers to continue investigating public employees for misconduct related to their official duties even if the employee retires during the investigation. If the investigation suggests criminal activity, the employer must refer the case to law enforcement, and any resulting felony conviction would lead to forfeiture of all accrued public retirement benefits, in line with existing pension forfeiture laws. The bill imposes new duties on local agencies and provides for state reimbursement if mandated costs arise."
