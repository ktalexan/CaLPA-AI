summary: "Assembly Bill 682, introduced in the California Legislature for the 2025-2026 session, would require health care service plans and health insurers to include detailed monthly reporting on claims processing, denials, and appeals, including the use of artificial intelligence or predictive algorithms, as part of their existing financial and enrollment reports to state regulators. The bill mandates public disclosure of this claims denial data on departmental websites, specifying breakdowns by reason for denial and tracking the outcomes of internal and external appeals. Violations by health care service plans would constitute a crime, but the bill specifies that no state reimbursement to local agencies is required, as any costs arise solely from the creation or modification of criminal penalties."
