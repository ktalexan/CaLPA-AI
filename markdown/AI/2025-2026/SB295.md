summary: "Senate Bill 295, the California Preventing Algorithmic Collusion Act of 2025, aims to regulate the use of pricing algorithms in business by prohibiting the use or distribution of algorithms that use, incorporate, or are trained with competitor data, and requiring certain disclosures to customers and workers when prices or terms are set by algorithms. The bill authorizes the Attorney General to request information about pricing algorithms, enforce compliance through civil penalties, and seek remedies including fines, dissolution of violating corporations, and injunctive relief. Businesses with $5 million or more in annual revenue must disclose algorithmic pricing to customers and employees, and contracts violating these provisions are void. The law is intended to prevent tacit or explicit collusion facilitated by artificial intelligence and algorithmic tools, and strengthens antitrust enforcement in California."
