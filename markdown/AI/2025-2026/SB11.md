topic: "SB-11: Artificial intelligence technology."
title': "SB-11: An act to add Chapter 22.6 (commencing with Section 22650) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 3344 of the Civil Code, to add Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 1425) to Chapter 1 of Division 11 of the Evidence Code, and to add Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 540) to Title 13 of Part 1 of the Penal Code, relating to artificial intelligence technology."
summary: "Senate Bill 11, introduced by Senator Ashby in California's 2025–2026 session, amends existing laws to address the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that create 'digital replicas' of individuals' voices or likenesses. The bill clarifies that using such digital replicas to impersonate someone constitutes false personation under criminal law and extends civil liability for unauthorized use of a person's likeness or voice, including AI-generated content. It removes certain legal presumptions favoring employers in advertising, requires consumer warnings on AI technologies capable of creating digital replicas (with penalties for noncompliance), and directs the Judicial Council to develop court rules to assess AI-manipulated evidence by 2027. The Department of Consumer Affairs must define and publish the required consumer warning."
