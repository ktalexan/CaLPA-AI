summary: "Assembly Bill No. 316, introduced by Assembly Member Krell in the 2025–2026 California legislative session, proposes amending the Civil Code to prohibit developers or users of artificial intelligence systems from using the defense that harm was caused autonomously by AI in civil actions. This means that if AI causes injury, those responsible for developing or deploying it cannot avoid liability by claiming the AI acted independently. The bill also defines 'artificial intelligence' for these purposes and does not require appropriation, fiscal committee review, or create a local program."
