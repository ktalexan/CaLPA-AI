title': "AB-222: An act to amend Section 25402 of, and to add Chapter 4.4 (commencing with Section 25345) to Division 15 of, the Public Resources Code, and to add Section 451.4 to the Public Utilities Code, relating to energy."
summary: "Assembly Bill 222, introduced by Assembly Member Bauer-Kahan, would require developers of large artificial intelligence (AI) models to calculate and publicly disclose the total energy used and the percentage generated in California before commercial use or third-party access. The California Energy Commission must adopt efficiency standards for data centers by 2027, require reporting of data center energy use and trends, and ensure new or substantially altered data centers incorporate load-management capabilities. The Public Utilities Commission must review and minimize the costs of new or modified data centers for ratepayers who do not directly benefit. The bill aims to increase transparency and efficiency in the energy use of data centers supporting AI development."
