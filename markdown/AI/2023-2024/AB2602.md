summary: "Assembly Bill No. 2602 (Chapter 259), approved in California on September 17, 2024, adds Section 927 to the Labor Code to address contracts involving digital replicas of individuals for personal or professional services. Effective January 1, 2025, the bill makes unenforceable any contract provision allowing the use of a digital replica—defined as a computer-generated, highly realistic representation of a person's voice or likeness—in place of the individual's actual work, unless the contract includes a specific description of intended uses and the individual was represented by legal counsel or a labor union, or the use aligns with the original contract's terms. The law aims to protect individuals from unauthorized or vaguely defined uses of their digital likenesses in employment agreements."
