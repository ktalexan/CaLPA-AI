summary: "Senate Bill 11, introduced by Senator Ashby in California, seeks to regulate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that create digital replicas of individuals. The bill redefines and clarifies legal terms around digital replication, making the use of AI-generated digital replicas for impersonation purposes a form of false personation under criminal law. It also amends civil law to treat AI-generated voices or likenesses as equivalent to genuine ones if a reasonable person would be deceived, removing certain legal defenses for incidental use. The bill requires providers of such AI technologies to issue consumer warnings about potential legal liabilities, with enforcement and penalties for non-compliance, and tasks the Judicial Council with updating court evidence rules to address AI-manipulated evidence by 2027."
