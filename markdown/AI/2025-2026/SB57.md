summary: "Senate Bill 57 (2025), known as the Ratepayer and Technological Innovation Protection Act and introduced by Senator Padilla, requires the California Public Utilities Commission to establish or modify a special tariff for large electricity consumers—defined as 'eligible customers' with transmission-level service of at least 50 kV and 50 MW demand—by July 1, 2026. The bill aims to support the rapid growth of energy-intensive industries like artificial intelligence and data centers while protecting existing ratepayers from cost shifts, ensuring just and reasonable rates, and advancing state climate goals. It authorizes the commission to require distributed energy storage and zero-carbon procurement, ensures grid investments are recoverable from eligible customers, and places no new reimbursement requirements on local agencies."
