title': "ACA-2: A resolution to propose to the people of the State of California an amendment to the Constitution of the State, by repealing and adding Section 4.5 of Article IV thereof, relating to the Legislature."
summary: "The California Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2 (Legislative Diversification Act), introduced by Assembly Member Jackson for the 2025–2026 session, proposes to amend the state constitution to allow members of the Legislature elected or serving on or after November 1, 2010, to participate in a new retirement system, repealing the current prohibition on legislative pensions. Members would need at least 10 years of service to qualify for retirement benefits, though those with less service could transfer their credits to other public pension systems. The amendment aims to address inequities from the 1990 ban, which limited opportunities for individuals from lower- and middle-income backgrounds to serve in the Legislature, and to promote greater diversity and representation by making legislative service more accessible."
