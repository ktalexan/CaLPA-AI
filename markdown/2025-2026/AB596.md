title': "AB-596: An act to add Section 6403.7 to the Labor Code, relating to occupational safety."
summary: "Assembly Bill No. 596, introduced by Assembly Member McKinnor during the 2025–2026 California legislative session, seeks to add Section 6403.7 to the Labor Code to strengthen occupational safety laws by prohibiting employers from preventing employees from wearing face coverings, including respirators, at work unless doing so would create a safety hazard. The bill defines what constitutes a face covering and a respirator, aligns with existing regulations, and clarifies that violations would constitute a crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. The bill also states that no reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts as any costs incurred relate to changes in criminal law definitions or penalties."
