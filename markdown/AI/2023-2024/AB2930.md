summary: "California Assembly Bill 2930, introduced by Assembly Member Bauer-Kahan, seeks to regulate the use of automated decision systems (ADS) that utilize artificial intelligence to make consequential decisions affecting individuals, such as employment or access to services. The bill requires both deployers and developers of ADS to conduct annual impact assessments evaluating risks of algorithmic discrimination, notify individuals subject to consequential decisions, offer opportunities to correct personal data, and, where feasible, provide alternatives to automated decisions. If an impact assessment identifies a reasonable risk of algorithmic discrimination, the ADS cannot be used or made available until the risk is mitigated. The Civil Rights Department is empowered to investigate violations, request impact assessments, and bring civil actions with penalties up to $25,000 per violation involving algorithmic discrimination. The bill exempts certain small deployers and cybersecurity technologies, protects trade secrets, and ensures cumulative rights under other laws."
