summary: "Senate Bill 57, the Ratepayer and Technological Innovation Protection Act, requires the California Public Utilities Commission to establish or modify a special tariff for large electricity customers (such as data centers with high transmission-level demand) by July 1, 2026. The tariff must ensure fair rates, prevent cost shifts to other customers, support grid reliability, promote climate goals, and allow the Commission to require distributed energy storage or backup systems. The bill aims to balance the rapid growth of energy-intensive technologies like artificial intelligence with protections for existing ratepayers and the environment, without requiring state reimbursement for local agencies."
