title': "AB-1018: An act to add Chapter 24.6 (commencing with Section 22756) to Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code, to amend Section 51 of the Civil Code, and to add Article 3 (commencing with Section 12959) to Chapter 6 of Part 2.8 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to artificial intelligence."
summary: "California Assembly Bill 1018 (2025), the Automated Decisions Safety Act, would regulate the development and use of automated decision systems (ADS) that make consequential decisions affecting individuals in areas such as employment, education, housing, healthcare, and more. The bill requires ADS developers to conduct regular performance evaluations and share results with deployers, who must in turn provide disclosures, opt-out opportunities, and appeals processes to affected individuals. Covered ADS must undergo third-party audits, and both developers and deployers are required to maintain records and designate compliance officers. The Attorney General and other public entities are empowered to enforce compliance, with civil penalties for violations. The law exempts certain ADS uses (e.g., cybersecurity, aviation), protects trade secrets, and clarifies that these regulations do not override existing civil rights or privacy laws."
