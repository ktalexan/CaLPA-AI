summary: "Senate Joint Resolution No. 2, introduced by Senators Cortese and Cervantes in California's 2025–2026 legislative session, urges President Donald J. Trump and Congress to pass federal legislation guaranteeing comprehensive rights and protections for classified school workers (such as paraeducators, clerical staff, bus drivers, and custodians). The resolution highlights issues such as undercompensation, lack of benefits, inadequate staffing, and exclusion from policy decisions, and calls for livable wages, affordable healthcare, paid leave (including for school closures and family needs), professional development, workplace safety, job security, inclusion in policy-making, protections regarding the use of artificial intelligence and monitoring technologies, and the right to collective bargaining. The measure emphasizes the essential role of classified workers in supporting students and maintaining effective, safe school environments."
