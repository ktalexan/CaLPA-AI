summary: "California Assembly Bill 853, introduced by Assembly Member Wicks as the California AI Transparency Act, seeks to enhance transparency and accountability in generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The bill requires creators of large, publicly accessible generative AI systems to provide free AI detection tools that can identify AI-generated or altered content and display related provenance data. It further mandates that large online platforms retain and make available provenance data for content, and that manufacturers of capture devices (such as phones and cameras) include user-enabled provenance features in their default apps. The bill establishes civil penalties for violations and defines key terms like 'provenance data,' 'large online platform,' and 'capture device,' aiming to help verify the authenticity and origin of digital content in California."
