title': "SB-813: An act to add Chapter 14 (commencing with Section 8898) to Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code, relating to artificial intelligence."
summary: "Senate Bill 813, introduced by Senator McNerney in California's 2025–2026 legislative session, establishes a framework for the Attorney General to designate private entities as multistakeholder regulatory organizations (MROs) to certify and oversee the safety of artificial intelligence (AI) models and applications. These MROs must present detailed risk mitigation plans addressing issues like cybersecurity and potential high-impact threats, audit developers, decertify noncompliant AI systems, and submit annual reports on AI risks and mitigation measures. The bill provides an affirmative legal defense for AI developers in civil cases if their AI systems were certified by an MRO, except in cases of intentional misconduct. This semiprivate, adaptive approach aims to balance innovation, public safety, and accountability in AI governance, moving away from traditional government-only regulation."
