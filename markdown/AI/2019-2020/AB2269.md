summary: "California Assembly Bill 2269, introduced by Assembly Member Chau in 2020, proposes the Automated Decision Systems Accountability Act, which would require businesses in California that use automated decision systems (ADS) to regularly assess and report on the impact of these systems, particularly regarding potential biases and adverse effects on protected classes. The bill mandates annual impact assessments, continual bias testing, and reports to the Department of Business Oversight, with civil penalties for noncompliance. It also calls for the creation of an advisory task force to review and advise on ADS use in various sectors, aiming to prevent discrimination and ensure fairness in automated decision-making."
