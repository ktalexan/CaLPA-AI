summary: "Assembly Bill 512, introduced by Assembly Member Harabedian, amends California law to require health care service plans and disability insurers to make prior authorization decisions for health care services within 48 hours for standard requests and 24 hours for urgent requests, significantly shortening the current timelines. The bill also introduces strict guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms, or other software tools in utilization review or management, ensuring these tools do not replace provider judgment, must use individualized clinical data, and cannot make final medical necessity determinations, which must be made by licensed professionals. The bill establishes penalties for noncompliance, clarifies that no state reimbursement is required for local agencies, and mandates compliance with state and federal laws regarding patient data and nondiscrimination."
