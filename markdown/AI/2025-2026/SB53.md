summary: "Senate Bill 53, introduced by Senator Wiener in California's 2025–2026 legislative session, proposes the creation of a public cloud computing cluster called 'CalCompute' to advance the safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). The bill establishes a consortium to develop a framework for CalCompute, with a report due to the Legislature by January 1, 2027, after which the consortium will be dissolved. Additionally, SB 53 strengthens whistleblower protections for employees working with certain high-risk AI foundation models, prohibiting retaliation for disclosing critical risks or false statements about risk management, and requires developers to provide anonymous reporting processes and clear employee notices. The bill defines 'critical risk' as AI activities that could foreseeably cause mass harm or significant financial damage, and provides for legal remedies including attorney fees and injunctive relief for violations."
