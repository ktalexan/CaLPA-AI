summary: "Assembly Bill No. 3339, the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act (KIDS Act), introduced by Assembly Member Wicks in California's 2019-2020 legislative session, aims to protect children under 16 online by prohibiting certain manipulative or harmful features on platforms directed at children. The bill bans auto-play, push alerts, and engagement-based rewards, restricts exposure to sexual, violent, or exploitative content, and limits commercial advertising tactics such as host-selling, native advertising, and branded content targeting minors. It requires platforms to use age verification data solely for that purpose, mandates annual audits of the largest child-directed platforms, and tasks the Attorney General with issuing regulations to ensure compliance. Violations are deemed unfair competition under state law."
