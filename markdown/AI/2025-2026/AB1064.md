summary: "California Assembly Bill 1064, the Leading Ethical AI Development (LEAD) for Kids Act, establishes regulations and oversight for artificial intelligence (AI) systems used by or affecting children. The bill creates the LEAD for Kids Standards Board to set risk-based criteria, require registration, risk assessments, audits, and public labeling for AI products targeting children or using children's data. It prohibits certain high-risk uses (like manipulative chatbots, biometric data processing, and social scoring), mandates strong consent requirements, and enables civil penalties and legal action by harmed children or parents. The law aims to ensure AI products are safe, transparent, and ethically developed for minors, with enforcement by the Attorney General and a dedicated state fund for administration."
