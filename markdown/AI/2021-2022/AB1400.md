summary: "California Assembly Bill 1400, known as the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (CalCare), proposes to establish a comprehensive, universal single-payer health care system for all California residents, regardless of immigration status. CalCare would replace most existing public and private health insurance programs, covering a wide range of medical, mental health, dental, vision, and long-term care services with no premiums, copays, or deductibles. The program would be governed by an independent CalCare Board, with public advisory committees and a trust fund for financing, and would require providers to participate under strict non-discrimination and transparency rules. The bill mandates cost controls, collective provider negotiations, and prioritizes care quality, accessibility, and reduction of administrative waste. Implementation depends on securing necessary federal waivers, legislative approval, public approval of new revenue mechanisms, and a fiscal analysis confirming the program’s financial sustainability."
