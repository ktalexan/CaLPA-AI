summary: "California Assembly Bill 1331, introduced by Assembly Member Elhawary and coauthors, aims to restrict employers' use of workplace surveillance tools by prohibiting monitoring in off-duty areas (such as bathrooms, breakrooms, and personal spaces) and granting workers the right to disable or leave behind surveillance devices during off-duty hours.
