summary: "California Assembly Bill 2200, known as the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (CalCare), proposes to establish a comprehensive, universal single-payer health care system for all California residents. The bill would replace existing public and private health coverage with CalCare, covering a broad range of medical, mental health, long-term care, and preventive services without premiums, deductibles, or other cost-sharing. CalCare would be governed by an independent board, supported by advisory committees and an Office of Health Equity, and funded by federal and state sources, with the intent to develop a new revenue plan. The program would negotiate prices for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, control costs through global budgets and fee-for-service rates, and emphasize health equity, workforce development, and consumer protections. Implementation depends on securing sufficient funding and necessary federal waivers, with a transition period to ensure continuity of care and workforce support. The bill also includes strong nondiscrimination provisions and privacy protections for enrollees."
