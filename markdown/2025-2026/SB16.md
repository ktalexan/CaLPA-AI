summary: "Senate Bill 16 (2025), introduced by Senator Blakespear, amends California's housing and homelessness laws to require local governments that do not receive Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prevention (HHAP) program funding to include updated data on unhoused individuals and specific action plans to reduce and prevent homelessness in their housing elements. The bill also mandates the Department of Housing and Community Development to develop, in coordination with local jurisdictions, a comprehensive 10-year assessment and financing plan to address unsheltered and chronic homelessness, with a report due to the Legislature by December 31, 2027. The assessment must detail the current and projected numbers of unsheltered individuals, unmet service needs, evidence-based interventions, required funding, and recommendations for state and local action. The bill imposes state-mandated local programs and provides for reimbursement of costs if determined necessary, and explicitly applies to all California cities, including charter cities."
