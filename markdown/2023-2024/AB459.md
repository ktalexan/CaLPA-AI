summary: "Assembly Bill No. 459, introduced by Assembly Member Kalra, amends California law to require state and local law enforcement agencies to report detailed stop data to the Attorney General by March 1 each year, with semiannual reporting required if errors are found. The bill clarifies that open text or narrative fields in the reports, which may contain personally identifiable information, are only to be made public by the reporting agency and not by the Attorney General, in order to protect privacy. However, the Attorney General must provide all stop data, including these fields, to approved entities for research on racial and identity profiling, under strict confidentiality agreements. The legislation also addresses procedures for state reimbursement of local agency costs and includes findings justifying the limitation of public access to sensitive information."
