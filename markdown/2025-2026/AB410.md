summary: "Assembly Bill No. 410, introduced in the California Legislature, proposes updates to existing law regarding the use of bots online. The bill requires that any person using a bot powered by generative artificial intelligence to autonomously communicate with individuals in California must ensure the bot clearly discloses its non-human status at the start of the interaction, truthfully answers questions about its identity, and does not attempt to mislead users about being a human. The definition of 'bot' is updated to include AI-generated outputs that could reasonably be mistaken for a human, and exemptions apply if a stricter disclosure law already covers the bot. Violations can be pursued by the Attorney General or local prosecutors, with possible civil penalties of $1,000 per violation."
